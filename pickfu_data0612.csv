1,Male,$31-60k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Arcade; Role Playing; Sports,Daily,D is the character design that I think fits the description best. This character has a bolder and more futuristic style.
2,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Sports; Strategy; Arcade; Adventure; Action,Daily,the character in option B has the most matching description and i like the olive drab uniform
3,Male,$0-30k,Hispanic,Vocational Training,25-34,Strategy; Role Playing; Action,Never,"This outfit seems the most fitting to his personality, as well as using a sniper rifle."

6,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Puzzle; Card; Board,Daily,Picked in order of what fit a university professor best.. although I could easily flip A and C on my choices.
7,Male,$61-100k,Other,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Adventure,Weekly,I most prefer option D as the bow looks really cool. The other options are fine as well but did not really stand out or catch my attention as option D did.
8,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Trivia; Puzzle; Educational; Board; Action,Weekly,It was kind of a toss up between number 3 and number 4 but number one and number 2 I think really show The idea of a post Apocalypse better. Number one he really looks like a bad a** and a rebel which I think is what you're going for. The same token he also looks smart
9,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Adventure; Board; Card; Casino,Weekly,"Scientist would not likely be an expert with bows or crossbows.  Thus, I would expect him to use a rifle."
10,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Adventure; Strategy; Role Playing,Daily,"I don't think any of these go with the description of a socially awkward genius, but I suppose B looks the most shy."
11,Male,$0-30k,White,Less than High School Diploma,35-44,Card; Role Playing; Adventure; Strategy; Arcade,Monthly,"I like the look of A even though he is giving me Van Helsing vibes, I feel that it fits the theme better compared to the others."
12,Male,$0-30k,White,High School,25-34,Action; Adventure; Puzzle; Word; Music,Weekly,"A, the way the character looks makes me feel they are socially anxious based on the two weapons that are held, and the stance.B, The character's posture makes me feel they are a little shy and anxious which makes the description seem accurate.C, the character has a fairly confident stance and it makes me think they don't match the description very well.D, I like the weapon, and think it would fit well with the character's description, however the character's posture looks more confident than the description."
13,Male,$61-100k,Black,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Adventure; Action; Role Playing; Strategy; Simulation,Daily,I like option C the best because the character is dressed in a way that resembles his biological background.
14,Male,$61-100k,White,Associate Degree,35-44,Puzzle; Trivia,Rarely,I like option D because the white coat gives him an educated look better.
15,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Music; Sports; Action; Arcade; Casino,Weekly,"Option B stood out the most to me, primarily because I like the look and the description fits that the best overall, in my opinion. That being said, I think any of these choices are certainly viable."
16,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Puzzle; Sports; Strategy,Daily,The scarf that covers some of his face definitely fits really well with the shy and socially awkward description.  The monocle also gives the impression that he is some sort of eccentric genius.
17,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Sports; Role Playing; Arcade; Adventure; Action,Daily,"Option D is what I would envision for a character with this type of personality. They look like somebody that is young, and anxious. The character looks simple from a design standpoint, but their face could show a wide range of emotion."
18,Male,$61-100k,Black,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Adventure; Racing; Strategy; Action; Simulation,Daily,"I think Option D looks like the best design out of the four choices. The overall design of Option D just looks better than the others. I can't say any specific design really fits the description of the character though. All of the designs look very confident, etc."
19,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Action; Adventure; Strategy; Trivia; Word,Rarely,"The white outfit in D stood out to me and made the character interesting. I also liked the active pose, which seemed more dynamic. I think he fits the description well."
20,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Adventure; Arcade; Puzzle; Role Playing; Strategy,Weekly,Honestly I don't feel that any of the presented images match the description all that well. None of them look like a university professor or a biology genius to me. They just look like generic gang members with out of context weapons.
21,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Simulation; Sports; Action; Role Playing,Daily,I__ not sure any of these really seem to fit well. The characters do not really look anxious to me so I__ not sure it__ relevant. I think that B is the closest match.
22,Male,$0-30k,White,Associate Degree,35-44,Action; Puzzle; Strategy,Daily,I pick B in this because of the key phrase social anxiety. I feel this look fits this description the best. You could make a case for C also but I don__ see it in both A or D at all. Both are too flashy for me and I don__ think it fits the description.
23,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Adventure; Casino; Music; Sports,Daily,"Options D and C, in that order, are my preferred choices because these characters have the look of guys who can take care of business even though they are a genius with good intentions and strength of character."
24,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Strategy; Puzzle,Rarely,"Outfits for A/B look most like what i associate with ""on the run"". C looks like he's a soldier and white-jacket D doesn't look inconspicuous enough."
25,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Trivia; Strategy,Never,"I think that option D is the best design.  It is creative, unique, and make captures my attention.  I think the design is cool and appealing"
26,Male,$0-30k,Black,Associate Degree,35-44,Arcade; Simulation; Board; Role Playing; Strategy,Daily,"I like the double crossbows in A. I like the crossbow in B. I like the looks and colors of D. While I like the bow in C, I hate the color of the coat."
27,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Simulation; Sports; Strategy; Adventure; Action,Monthly,I liked A because I thought the description of being a professor matched the look of the character
28,Male,$101k+,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Adventure; Action; Strategy; Role Playing; Simulation,Daily,"This is a reserved person, so I want a reserved outfit. D is too outlandish and A seems like he is too put together for being a bio genius. C and B are both good, but I like how C is hiding his face a bit, which indicates that maybe he is a bit socially anxious."
29,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,25-34,Strategy; Word; Puzzle; Action,Daily,"I think B looks the coolest. He's got this really interesting wrist bow that I've never seen before. He overall looks great. He doesn't really fit the description at all, and to be honest, none of them do. None of these pictures looks like a University Professor. That being said, I do think B and D look the best. C and A aren't bad either, it's just that I think he looks more of a 'bad guy' in those two choices. The description made him out to be a good guy."
30,Male,$61-100k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,21-24,Card; Strategy; Simulation; Adventure; Action,Daily,"The character descritptions and personality traits match the art style of a thinner, more passive lookign character especially with weapon choice such as the bow and crossbow. Option C is too far from a good choice since he has a gun, the bows fit the character description more but Option D's style looks the best."
31,Male,$31-60k,White,Graduate Degree,25-34,Adventure; Simulation; Strategy; Sports; Trivia,Monthly,I like the look and the weapon on this guy the best. The gun looks powerful. He looks young and like he could do a lot of damage he looks like he could be a professor and fits the description as well. I don__ really like that he is an anxious person
32,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Casino; Puzzle; Trivia,Daily,I feel the outfit and the look of the character in D fits the description the best. I like the white outfit as it science background. I think both the gun and the bow are nice but I like the bow used in D the best overall. I don't like the two bows as weapons in A and I don't like the pose or the outfit. I feel A's outfit seems too much like it belongs in the west and part of a cowboy story. B doesn't stand out too much but look like it fits the character better than A does.
33,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Action; Arcade; Role Playing; Strategy; Puzzle,Weekly,"The last place choice was easy, the character's face seemed to confident and just cool to be someone who is socially anxious and shy, it did not fit the description at all.  In the third place choice the two weapon stance of the character is goofy looking and I am not a fan of the clothing, though the facial expression is good.  The first and second place choice are both pretty good.  They get it right with the weapon and the face/expression.  First place wins because the clothing looks a bit more nerdy to me."
34,Male,$61-100k,Hispanic,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Strategy; Sports; Action; Role Playing; Racing,Daily,"C. I think that from his face you can tell he is young and can pass as shy. I think his clothes speak to someone that is going to be using bilogical weapons as they are highly protective of his body and skin. His weapon of choice is also something that is modern and could be biological. So to me, this one fits the most.D. Fits the part with the way he looks and is dressed but not so much the weaponry. A. Can somewhat fit the look although the clothes are a bit off and  the weapons are OK. B. Looks like a female and the name sounds like a make so she is out."
35,Male,$31-60k,Asian,Graduate Degree,25-34,Trivia; Strategy; Simulation; Role Playing; Action,Daily,I prefer C over other options because the character in C has distinct outlook with appealing features
36,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Arcade; Card; Educational; Puzzle; Music,Daily,I like the brown/gray pallet for the coloring on choice A the most it looks like someone traditionally who would use crossbows
37,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Strategy; Puzzle; Adventure,Daily,I like option D because the description matches the outfit nicely. He looks more realistic and I really like the use of the bow and arrow.
38,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Strategy; Trivia,Daily,Option D shows a lot of confidence so that is my last choice and does not fit the overall vibe of the description. Option B is the best choice because the character looks timid but smart and seems to best fit the description.
39,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Sports; Adventure; Strategy; Role Playing,Daily,"C looks the most fierce and like someone part of a rebel organization, as well as like a German. A has less practical weapons than C but looks visually interesting and like someone in a rag-tag group. B looks very strange and not fun to play, as well as not menacing. D looks too snobby, clean, and refined to be a rebel fighter. Moreover, D looks like the character is at an archery match or practice which does not fit the description at all."
40,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Action; Puzzle; Trivia; Strategy,Weekly,I like the designs that are more understated as opposed to the ones that are bolder and stand out more
41,Male,$101k+,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Arcade; Action; Adventure,Daily,I like option A because its hard to beat a dual wield of bows and arrows. It looks pretty menacing.
42,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,35-44,Adventure; Simulation; Strategy; Trivia; Role Playing,Daily,"I like the man with the two weapons in A, I think that it provides versatility"
43,Male,$31-60k,White,Associate Degree,25-34,Adventure; Arcade,Rarely,"I think option D looks the like it fits the description the most, slightly futuristic while still giving a good ascetic, Option A would be the closest next to that one, Option C I think looks cool in its own right but too futuristic and over the top.  Option B I think makes him look creepy"
44,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Sports,Monthly,Choice A is the one that I really fits the description the best because I like the eye scouter thing that he is wearing as it fits to me with him being a research and scientific genius that he would want something like that to help enhance him when he has to fight. I also feel like the outfit fits the best for someone who seems like they would fight at ranged stealth. Choice B is second because the wrist crossbow struck me as a weapon that someone who is a genius would have made and would be the only one to use. His look also comes off as being someone with his personality. Choice D is third because I like that he uses the crossbow like the first two as that fits with the character to me but everything else does not fit. His outfit and stance here does not strikes me as socially anxious genius. Choice C is last because I do not like that he uses a gun and his look here comes off more like he would be a frontlines solider as opposed to a scientist.
45,Male,$61-100k,Asian,Graduate Degree,35-44,Casino; Simulation; Adventure; Trivia; Sports,Daily,The character of Mikael looks fitting for option D the most. Great with the bow there. This is a unique look and think that is captured well in option D. I'd go with that as the better choice overall. I think that works out well for the character here. Option C is not bad but they have a firearm which I think is not as fit for him. Option A has a strange and unnatural look with the gun and crossbow. Option B is okay but not sure about that outfit.
46,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,35-44,Action; Adventure,Rarely,"B fits the ""shy but rational and calculating"" archtype. The others all look too much like hero or warrior personalities based o their poses and style of dress."
47,Male,$61-100k,Asian,Graduate Degree,25-34,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Racing; Sports,Daily,I ranked the designs of the Mikael character that I liked the most.  I liked the double crossbows of option A the most followed by the design of the character of option D followed by option B and then finally option C.
48,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,35-44,Casino; Adventure; Arcade; Action; Role Playing,Daily,"My top 2 picks seem like they would be reasonable designs based on the type of character he is, and the weapons he uses would likely fit his personality."
49,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Adventure; Strategy; Role Playing; Simulation,Daily,"A seems like the best hear. I feel like the weapon goes with the biological more than the others. B, D, and C all have weapons that don't really fit the mold of someone who is shy and uses biological weapons."
50,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Sports; Strategy; Arcade; Adventure; Action,Daily,i think the character in option B most fits with the description and i like her manner of dress
51,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Racing; Arcade; Board; Adventure; Action,Daily,"This design has a very subdued but also overall very powerful look to her because of her face details, outfit and general pose."
52,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Puzzle; Card; Board,Daily,Ranked in order of the look and style that I feel most goes with her back story. She a bit of a crime boss now so she has to be dynamic and larger than life
53,Male,$31-60k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Arcade; Role Playing; Sports,Daily,B is the more accurate depiction of the character description. I sense that this character has more personality than the other ones and has more ability to be charming and charismatic.
54,Male,$61-100k,Other,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Adventure,Weekly,"I most prefer option D. This character really seems like a warrior and is unafraid of mixing it up with the best of them. They are attractive, but also very athletic."
55,Male,$0-30k,Hispanic,Vocational Training,25-34,Strategy; Role Playing; Action,Never,"Her outfit is very reminiscent of an assassin I have seen in other video games, and her weapon fits the theme well."
56,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Adventure; Board; Card; Casino,Weekly,Assasins usually tend not to show their faces and wear darker clothing.  Choice C shows the proper gun an assassin would use.
57,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Adventure; Strategy; Role Playing,Daily,"They're all pretty close, but I think C fits the best with the face covering.  The whole everyone who sees me fire a gun thing is way over the top, so I think it has to be someone who looks hidden or secretive."
58,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Word; Puzzle; Family; Educational; Card,Weekly,I prefer option b because i feel her costume and her personality exactly suits the following character which was mentioned above
59,Male,$0-30k,White,High School,25-34,Action; Adventure; Puzzle; Word; Music,Weekly,"B, the character's stance looks confident, and they appear to holsters, or sheaths, this makes the character fit very well with the description that they specialize in assassination and are unafraid of violence.D, the character looks like they are ready for a fight based on how they are holding the knife and they appear to have more weapons on their back.C, this character looks very ready for violence based on the large machine gun on their back, this fits well with the description.A, the character looks a little too high class, they also don't appear to be carrying four guns."
60,Male,$61-100k,Black,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Adventure; Action; Role Playing; Strategy; Simulation,Daily,"I like option B the best because the character is dressed in a way that reflects her use of guns as her main weapon.  What I like are that the guns she has in her holsters are small, which would allow for her to be fast and use 4 guns at one time."
61,Male,$61-100k,White,Associate Degree,35-44,Puzzle; Trivia,Rarely,I like option C because the weapons are bigger and easier to notice.
62,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Trivia; Puzzle; Educational; Board; Action,Weekly,"all of these are really nice, 1just looks awesome, she looks a bit like she popped out of the matrix with Neo. she has the most obvious weapons and looks the most deadly.  2 really exemplifies her blades the most and i think more assassin. not a huge fan of the boots in 2 just because they look rather hard to fight and be stealthy in. 3 and 4 are nice, but 3 is a bit too covered up. 4 the shadow seems part of her hair, which is the case in 2 and 3 a bit too."
63,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Puzzle; Sports; Strategy,Daily,"The footwear is what stand out most to me because she needs to be athletic and agile, so flat boots fit much better than heels.  I also like that her weapons aren't as obvious, which would make her more dangerous."
64,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Sports; Role Playing; Arcade; Adventure; Action,Daily,"Based on the character description, Option A is the most logical match. The character gives off vibes that they dont care about violence, and can be moody. Their natural demeanor conveys that. The visual designs are well done."
65,Male,$61-100k,Black,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Adventure; Racing; Strategy; Action; Simulation,Daily,Option B is the clear winner of the four choices. Option B's design fits the description perfectly in my opinion.
66,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Adventure; Arcade; Puzzle; Role Playing; Strategy,Weekly,"I think C and D are best becuse they show guns and look more like an assassin character. To me B looks like a generic high level soldier and A looks like a ninja, both of which dont jive with the description."
67,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Action; Adventure; Strategy; Trivia; Word,Rarely,"I prefer choice B. I like that black Latinas get some representation. On that characteristic alone, it makes her look more unique and interesting, I also like her hair, which looks cool and different."
68,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Adventure; Casino; Music; Sports,Daily,Option A is my favorite because this character is equipped and also has an attitude and bearing that conveys strength and fortitude and the ability to handle herself in any crisis.
69,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Simulation; Sports; Action; Role Playing,Daily,I think that c looks the most athletic and capable. They look like someone who is experienced and dangerous.
70,Male,$0-30k,White,Associate Degree,35-44,Action; Puzzle; Strategy,Daily,I think A fits the best with the witching part. I think the rest of the description fits well for all of them but when it comes to bewitching that__ the one.
71,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Trivia; Strategy,Never,I feel that option A best represents the description and has a cool appearance.  THe design is cool and makes me interested in learning more
72,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Strategy; Puzzle,Rarely,"D looks most like a badass assassin. I love A's outfit but i'm not sure it's subtle enough to avoid being noticed, which is not generally great for assassins. C looks like a sniper which is still fitting. B looks more like a mad scientist."
73,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Simulation; Sports; Strategy; Adventure; Action,Monthly,"I liked option D because the outfit was a little less elaborate, and also the character looked athletic"
74,Male,$101k+,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Adventure; Action; Strategy; Role Playing; Simulation,Daily,"Based on the keywords of being charming and having a bewitching personality, I like b best. The character pose seems open and engaging."
75,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,25-34,Strategy; Word; Puzzle; Action,Daily,"A feels like the best option here since I can actually see the blades on her back. I also really like the design of her. Out of the 4 choices, she fit it the best. Option D wasn't bad, but it was definitely far behind A in my opinion. The other 2 aren't very great and they lack personality in my opinion."
76,Male,$61-100k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,21-24,Card; Strategy; Simulation; Adventure; Action,Daily,"The description matches the art style for charcter A the most, the biggest factor is that Cookie is an assassin and that she has a bewithcing personaloty and the style of choice A fits those descriptions the best. The other options fill in the assassin portion but not the personalities as much, Option C if too far from it."
77,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Casino; Trivia; Word; Action; Arcade,Daily,The stories of course are all far fetched so I picked based on the coolness of each and which I__ like to play.
78,Male,$101k+,Black,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Sports; Racing; Puzzle; Adventure; Action,Daily,I would choose choice C first because of the outfit of the person pictured above because the description best suits the person then I would choose choice D which has a better image which matches the descriptions given on the text then choice A which is not really attractive as per the image and also the description given in the context do not reflect the person in the image and the last choice will be B which gives the person in the photo a high level of description which is not really appealing to the reader.
79,Male,$101k+,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Word; Strategy; Role Playing; Adventure; Action,Daily,"Going by the character description where Cookie is a controller of the Black Swan Market, C feels like one of those powerful characters that owns part of the world. It has the look and confidence that no one would dare touch her. She has the look that she could charm you to her side. Definitely gives a power broker vibe and one that you give a wide berth when dealing with.In terms of the assassin part of her bio, I think D looks the best. This the look of an assassin that does her job but at the same time can potentially charm you into not getting in the way. C feels too serious which is good for an assassin but less so for Cookie's description.I don't think B fits that well. The outfit neither screams powerful or assassin. Potentially, it might be ""the true person behind those in power""."
80,Male,$31-60k,Asian,Graduate Degree,25-34,Trivia; Strategy; Simulation; Role Playing; Action,Daily,"I choose D because the graphic design of the character is visually attractive and creative as well, compared to other options"
81,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Action; Arcade; Role Playing; Strategy; Puzzle,Weekly,"Last place choice was easy the description of the character does not really say ""sexy"" to me (other than the term bewitching) but this version of the character does have sex appeal.  This character seems more like a cold blooded character.  The third place character does not quite get it either, it looks more of a lab rat type character with the coat that seems to be inspired by a lab coat.  The first place choice gets it perfectly, the character looks like a bad ass cold blooded killer."
82,Male,$61-100k,Hispanic,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Strategy; Sports; Action; Role Playing; Racing,Daily,A. Has a great Latin American stereotypical look going on with the earrings and their appearance. Also looks fierce with outfit as well as the choice of weapons. D. Great Latin American look and also has a great set of weapons.  The look is not as good as A though. B. Can pass for the Latin American look but I wish the weapons were shown more. C. Not really a great Latin American look and I dont like the face being covered since they are fearless in the bio.
83,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Arcade; Card; Educational; Puzzle; Music,Daily,This sounds like someone who would be sportier all together and overall would be on the slim side as well
84,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Strategy; Role Playing; Simulation; Action; Adventure,Weekly,It's  her posture.  It fits the confidence displayed in the description better than the others. The others look less fitting
85,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Strategy; Puzzle; Adventure,Daily,I like option A because she has a badass outfit. I think her description definitely aligns as well. I also think her hair and body look really sexy.
86,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Strategy; Trivia,Daily,I think option A is best because the skin tone of the character best matches the ethnicity stated.
87,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Action; Puzzle; Trivia; Strategy,Weekly,"I prefer the ones that seem more realistic and less ""over the top"" in design"
88,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Sports; Adventure; Strategy; Role Playing,Daily,"D looks the most like a fast, lethal assassin. B looks at least somewhat like an assassin but lacks the stylized hair of D that I think fits better. I also think B's portrayal of someone armed with 4 guns is poor. A looks like an assassin but otherwise the design is bland and ugly, especially the shiny coat that sticks out too much. C is my least favorite as the character looks too much like a heavy, slow gunner because of the large gun and not enough like a fast assassin."
89,Male,$101k+,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Arcade; Action; Adventure,Daily,I like Option C because she appears to be carrying a menacing weapon. The other options don__ even appear to have small weapons.
90,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,35-44,Adventure; Simulation; Strategy; Trivia; Role Playing,Daily,"the female character in D is the most appealing to me, I think she seems powerful but not too full of herself"
91,Male,$101k+,White,High School,35-44,Simulation; Strategy; Puzzle,Weekly,"A is colorful and her face is unobstructed.  She looks like she's from Latin America.  B has similar qualities, but the neutral clothing color scheme is less interesting.  D looks ok, but the hair style makes me think European.  C doesn't look like she fits the profile at all, and the mask annoys me."
92,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,35-44,Action; Adventure,Rarely,"To me, picture D fits the character best. B and C are sort of ok but B looks more like a settler or fremen on Dune than an assassin, C looks like she spends more time on her hair than her guns, and A is clothed in too fancy and pretty of clothes. D looks practical but deadly."
93,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Strategy; Simulation,Rarely,"I really like the appearance of C, I think she conveys the character the most in being mysterious and appearing threatening. I like the poses of the characters, I do not like the clothes on A or B much. I don't think they fit the menacing image as well."
94,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Sports,Monthly,"Choice D is the one that I like the best in terms of the design fitting with the description because she looks like she would be an athletic assassin here. The look and color of her outfit says to me that she can be stealthy but isn't worried about getting into a fight if she has to. She looks really athletic here as well and seems altered to give her abilities that are enhanced. Choice B is second because the eye scouter thing that she has seems like it would help her assess situations to assassinate. She seems like she is cocky and unafraid yet would be able to turn it on to bewitch if she had to. Her outfit has a flow to it that works for her. Choice A is third because while it is parts of the look that fit with her being charming, moody and unafraid of violence she did not strike as being as athletic or fast here as the first two choices. Choice C is last because her look here seems like she would be more like a solider as opposed to a speedy, athletic assassination specialist."
95,Male,$61-100k,Asian,Graduate Degree,25-34,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Racing; Sports,Daily,"I ranked the designs of the character ""Cookie"" that I liked the most.  I liked the style of option C the most followed by the design of option B then option D and then finally option A."
96,Male,$61-100k,Asian,Graduate Degree,35-44,Casino; Simulation; Adventure; Trivia; Sports,Daily,Great image in option B and love the flowing hair. That looks like an assassin there. I think that image represents her very well. Options A and D are not bad with the look here and she is tough. Love the intricacies of the outfit. Option C is alright too but would pretty to see a great hairstyle.
97,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,35-44,Casino; Adventure; Arcade; Action; Role Playing,Daily,"My top pick matches the description the best, especially with that name, which can't seem too tough based on her appearance."
98,Male,$31-60k,Black,High School,25-34,Puzzle,Daily,The name and ethnicity match this character design perfectly. You can also see here guns and she is holding a blade in her hand which is stated in the description.
99,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Adventure; Strategy; Role Playing; Simulation,Daily,I feel like C is the best. I feel it shows she is ready for violence.  She can be a good assassin with the weapons she is carrying. I don't really like the rest the weapons are not that great.
100,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Sports; Strategy; Arcade; Adventure; Action,Daily,i think the character in option A most fits the description on the side and i like her jacket
101,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Racing; Arcade; Board; Adventure; Action,Daily,I love this characters bio and her overall look as she has an air of being a genuine intellect and very witty with a lot going on.
102,Male,$61-100k,Other,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Adventure,Weekly,I most prefer option A. I love her personality and characteristics as she seems more intelligent and disciplined.
103,Male,$31-60k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Arcade; Role Playing; Sports,Daily,C is the one I prefer because this character has the more sophisticated and classy look. They seem to be a wise character. B is not as good because their jacket looks like a robe or something. A is not as interesting because their clothing makes me think more of a doctor.
104,Male,$101k+,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Educational,Daily,This product pictures best fit with description side in most beautiful attractive with person in looking is smart and the encourage in hope in person in very cute in this picture
105,Male,$61-100k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,21-24,Educational,Daily,This product pictures best fit with description side in most beautiful attractive with person in looking is smart and the encourage in hope in person
106,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Trivia; Puzzle; Educational; Board; Action,Weekly,I like the Gray suit I think it adds a nice bit to the description periodescription. I think it's very sad but I think you can clearly see the scar in both this picture in red dress. All of these are well done though
107,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Puzzle; Card; Board,Daily,I feel like option C exudes the most leadership and her face tells a strong background story. Option A has a strong doctor vibe. Option B feels more like a rich socialite than a politician
108,Male,$0-30k,Hispanic,Vocational Training,25-34,Strategy; Role Playing; Action,Never,"Her outfit reminds me of a strong, powerful independent woman who works in politics."
109,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Adventure; Board; Card; Casino,Weekly,Choice A looks more like a humans right champion.   Her clothing and other attributes of appearance looks more like she wants to support the people.
110,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Adventure; Strategy; Role Playing,Daily,"The description is pretty crazy.  Why would her husband donate his eye, since she appears to have another good one as only half her face was injured? Did he have three eyes?  Anyway, C seems the most stately.  The doctor theme doesn't seem to be in the description, and the bathrobe looking one is too casual."
111,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Word; Puzzle; Family; Educational; Card,Weekly,I prefer option b first because i feel like she is strong personality and her character is all about equality and human rights
112,Male,$0-30k,White,Less than High School Diploma,35-44,Card; Role Playing; Adventure; Strategy; Arcade,Monthly,"Something about the lab coat she is wearing and those glasses scream a Professor or Teacher, I feel it fits in perfect with her theme."
113,Male,$61-100k,Black,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Adventure; Action; Role Playing; Strategy; Simulation,Daily,I like option B the best because the image depicts her dressed in a way that makes her look like strong couragious person.
114,Male,$61-100k,White,Associate Degree,35-44,Puzzle; Trivia,Rarely,I like option A because the character looks more professional with the jacket on.
115,Male,$0-30k,White,High School,25-34,Action; Adventure; Puzzle; Word; Music,Weekly,"C, the angle that the character has their face makes it look like they are trying to not focus on their scar, the color of their coat also looks pleasant and makes them look like someone with that is a leader.A, the overall posture and appearance looks very confident and serious, their clothing also looks positive and makes them look like a leader.B, the coat looks like they are a person of wealth, however their stance looks less confident and it makes me less interested."
116,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Sports; Role Playing; Arcade; Adventure; Action,Daily,"Option C most closely matches the character description. Theres a sense of struggle in the characters demeanor, like they have been through things. They are well designed, and capable of displaying the necessary emotion."
117,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,35-44,Card; Adventure; Strategy; Role Playing; Simulation,Daily,Honestly I chose A because it's the only picture that does not kind of creep me out.  The other two look very strange with the arms cut off the way they are.  I realize that A has that too but it is angled so it does not look like it as much.
118,Male,$61-100k,Black,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Adventure; Racing; Strategy; Action; Simulation,Daily,I think Option C is the best fit for the description out of the three choices. The look of Option C really captures what the description is saying. Especially seeing the different eye color.
119,Male,$0-30k,Black,High School,21-24,Strategy; Sports,Monthly,I think option C has the best attire for the description because that grey long coat compliments the story very well. B is second to the first option because it fits the description more than A.
120,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Adventure; Role Playing; Strategy,Daily,C looks like a leader and fits the description best.  B just looks like a generic figure.  A looks like a dr.
121,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Puzzle; Sports; Strategy,Daily,"She looks very accomplished and steady and definitely like a savvy leader.   I think her special eye is the most prominent, which is important since it is such a critical part of her story."
122,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Adventure; Arcade; Puzzle; Role Playing; Strategy,Weekly,I think A looks the best and most fitting for the regent of a university. B looks like a normal housewife. C is terrible because the scarring is on the opposite side of the description
123,Male,$61-100k,Asian,Graduate Degree,25-34,Word; Trivia; Puzzle; Arcade; Action,Weekly,"Option C is the only one that accurately depicts scarring around the left eye from an injury that would require an eye transplant. However, none of the images depict burn scarring that should be covering half of her face."
124,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Action; Adventure; Strategy; Trivia; Word,Rarely,I prefer the face of choice A and think the lab coat gives her some credibility and character. I think I like that she looks a bit younger and more attractive than others
125,Male,$31-60k,White,Graduate Degree,25-34,Adventure; Simulation; Strategy; Sports; Trivia,Monthly,I think it is the best for the description and is the most attractive picture. She definitely looks firm and steady. She was probably a beautiful woman when she was younger. I would choose A second because she is more attractive than the other option
126,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Simulation; Sports; Action; Role Playing,Daily,I am not very good at evaluating peoples facial expressions like this. However I think that c is th best match as the woman had the look of sadness like someone who lost there husband would have.
127,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Adventure; Casino; Music; Sports,Daily,Option C is my top choice because this character has the appearance and bearing and attitude that fits the description perfectly based on her appearance and attitude and dress.
128,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Trivia; Strategy,Never,"I think that option A is the most unique and interesting character design.  I think that the character fits the description well, and makes me want to learn more."
129,Male,$101k+,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Word; Strategy; Role Playing; Adventure; Action,Daily,"I think C and A are pretty close to matching the description for me. Both have the aged and wise leader look to them but also the whole ""I'm tired of dealing this stupid"" look to them. I think the outfit in C and A look better than in B. I think a firm and steady leader would choose a less garish color and go for a more muted design. I like that C somewhat shows off the description (left eye of her lover's) while the other two kind of hide it. I think the glasses are a nice touch in A but the outfit feels too much scientist than leader.C definitely has more elements of the description and feel more in align to what I expect than the other two."
130,Male,$101k+,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Adventure; Action; Strategy; Role Playing; Simulation,Daily,The outfit in C looks a bit too bland. I like the white contrast with the blue in A.
131,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Simulation; Sports; Strategy; Adventure; Action,Monthly,"I liked option B, I thought the character looked like they would be a champion for equal rights"
132,Male,$0-30k,Black,Associate Degree,35-44,Arcade; Simulation; Board; Role Playing; Strategy,Daily,"I like the red in B, it pops out. The white coat in A makes her look like a doctor. I like the cost color in C"
133,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Casino; Puzzle; Trivia,Daily,I feel that the woman in C looks the most like she would have the drive to do what Mrs. Gold is trying to do. I like the scar on the face so show why she needs the eye and I feel that B looks too upper class and A looks too professional. I think the outfit in C is most fitting as well.
134,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,25-34,Strategy; Word; Puzzle; Action,Daily,"Truthfully, none of them jumped out at me. All of the concept pieces seemed pretty bland and lacked a bit of personality. I felt that C had a slight edge since she looked like she plays the description a little bit better than the other two. But A and B are tied for last and I wouldn't really consider them over C."
135,Male,$101k+,Black,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Sports; Racing; Puzzle; Adventure; Action,Daily,I would choose choice A first because it has a almost full picture of the person and the description also allows one to fit the words of the person as per the picture which is shown there then I would choose choice B which has a greater data of the person and the image of the person is not that shown much but it has a good measure where one can be able to attach the attributes of the person to the face of  the person and the last choice will be C which does not really have a detailed information about the person and also the image of the person is not that fully given to be able to attach the given information to the face of the person.
136,Male,$61-100k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,21-24,Card; Strategy; Simulation; Adventure; Action,Daily,I prefer choice A over the others on the basis of design and art style. The character descriptions and overall writing of every choice is really good and pulls the reader in so it was hard to choose between them. I chose art style as the deciding factor since the descriptions were all already good.
137,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Casino; Trivia; Word; Action; Arcade,Daily,"Overall including image and backstory, A wins out.  No image is bad nor is any stoey"
138,Male,$31-60k,Asian,Graduate Degree,25-34,Trivia; Strategy; Simulation; Role Playing; Action,Daily,"I choose B because the character in B is unique and the description is very appealing, compared to A or C"
139,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Action; Arcade; Role Playing; Strategy; Puzzle,Weekly,"The last place choice does not really get it for me.  I picture a tough old lady that has business skills but this version of the character reminds me more of a doctor than a business person mostly because of what looks like a lab coat.  The first place choice gets it right with the clothing and facial expression.  Looks like an old lady with a creepy left eye, and the clothing looks like business professional."
140,Male,$61-100k,Hispanic,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Strategy; Sports; Action; Role Playing; Racing,Daily,B is the most attractive one as she has a soft look to her face and a very caring demeanor. C has the demeanor to fit but her age is showing in the picture. A has the attractive looks but I think that the glasses throw her off.
141,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Arcade; Card; Educational; Puzzle; Music,Daily,The more approachable doctor picture looks good it also looks a tad bit young but in a trusting way
142,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Strategy; Role Playing; Simulation; Action; Adventure,Weekly,Her character is more unique than the rest.  I can get into her more due to her not being so typical looking
143,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Strategy; Trivia,Daily,I think the older woman seem to better embody the description of wise. I also think they portray stability. These are not characteristics I associate with young people like in option A.
144,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Strategy; Puzzle; Adventure,Daily,"I like option A because she has a wise and calm demeanor. I thin she also looks very realistic, which makes that character more believable and engaging."
145,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Sports; Adventure; Strategy; Role Playing,Daily,"C is the best option because the suit makes the character seem like the firm, steady leader described with a tough history. The outfit in B does not make much sense to me but the face and earrings make the character fit. I think B looks too much like a female Hugh Heffner. I do not think A fits as all as she looks more like a disheveled scientist than a strong leader. I think overall, the outfit is really important as well as the face. The face in C looks the most like someone burned, while A looks untouched, and B looks at least a little bit seasoned."
146,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Action; Puzzle; Trivia; Strategy,Weekly,I like the ones where she seems more formally dressed since she's a leader
147,Male,$101k+,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Arcade; Action; Adventure,Daily,I prefer option B. She looks more regal wearing red.
148,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,35-44,Adventure; Simulation; Strategy; Trivia; Role Playing,Daily,"The image and bio in A are appealing to me.   I think they compliment each other, the wording matches what I would expect the woman in the picture to be"
149,Male,$61-100k,Asian,Graduate Degree,35-44,Casino; Simulation; Adventure; Trivia; Sports,Daily,Option A has the best look for Minister Gold. This is a better and more complex individual. I like that representation here for the better choice. Seems to fit her  unique personality better with that coat on and the look there.
150,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,,,These elements look the best to match the type of character here
151,Male,$0-30k,Hispanic,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,A I feel has the best design that meshes well with the description that is given.
152,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,I think C fits the best because he looks somewhat fun and happy. I like that he's holding a drink.
153,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,25-34,,,I think option B embodies the smart and likes to have a good time description mentioned the most. I think that option A looks like a fool.
154,Male,$0-30k,White,High School,25-34,,,Basing it off the breaking bad guy is kind of funny and I find that the look he sports is close to what I would expect in choice B
155,Male,$61-100k,Hispanic,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,I feel like the smile on this characters face says that he is someone that is going to laugh and also be goofy and tell jokes. To me this matches something you are looking for.
156,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,"This character seems more realistic, approachable, and fitting based on the description of what this is supposed to be."
157,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,,,C looks like that guy that thinks he's a playboy and shows it in how he dresses. I chose him because I knew dudes like that back in the day.
158,Male,$31-60k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,,,A- this is a good and elegant outfit C-this has a modern and simple outlook to it B- this seems to be shabby and cool look
159,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,I prefer option C because he looks more thug and gangster than the other two options.
160,Male,$31-60k,Asian,Graduate Degree,25-34,,,"I choose C because the outlook and story of the character are very unique and creative, compared to other options"
161,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,,,"B has nice outfit choices such as necklaces, shoes, and jacket. A has good tattoos. c is okay"
162,Male,$61-100k,White,High School,35-44,,,"B looks exactly how I would picture him in my head. just looks like a fun guy to hang out with, and not like he's hiding a gun or going to break my legs"
163,Male,$0-30k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,I find option A is authentic. I prefer this because it is eye-catching.
164,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,35-44,,,I think my top pick works best because he looks like a modern drug dealing gangster with the baggy clothing.  He's likely to conceal weapons and such
165,Male,$31-60k,Black,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,The outfit in choice A is the best outfit for this character as it looks the most fashionable of all of the options I think the description is horrible though as most drug dealers that I personally know try not to life a high flashy life and don't keep mixed company because that is how you get set up for failure
166,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,35-44,,,"I think A looks like the description, to me at least. It fits what I would imagine that person is, C is close as well. But the extravagant outfit of A sells it."
167,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,I think the outfit and description for choice C is the best sounding of the 3 choices
168,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,"A is wearing super bright colors which just doesn't seem to be realistic, I think C looks the most confident in himself"
169,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,"I don't think any of the clothes really fit to be honest.  They are too conspicuous.  This one is better, but the green is still too much in my opinion."
170,Male,$31-60k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,I prefer option C because he feels the most interesting and likeable to me. Option A and B feel rather mediocre to me overall.
171,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,,,Three of the options were similar to each other. The drug dealers description was much detailed and will understands to the gamer easily. It was in an simple language. And the option A theme based drug dealers costume were looking good and appealing.
172,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,,,I chose option A.  I like this guy.  I think he fits the stereotype very well.
173,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,25-34,,,I like option C because it looks like the drug dealer has a lot of creativity and fun but also is still a drug dealer which makes it very fitting!
174,Male,$61-100k,Other,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,"Choice C looks like the character has a matching outfit, which is in-line with the persona and exudes wealthy drug-dealer. Choice B is in a similar vein, although, the non-matching jacket makes his persona a little less powerful. Choice A's outfit looks unkempt and less put-together. This would lead me to believe he has less money. Also, he has much more nondescript shoes which I cannot identify."
175,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,"We have a gang-themed mobile game, here are 3 styles of a drug dealer. Based on his description, which one fits the best? Which style do you prefer and why? What elements attract you the most?- These are cool character profiles. I like A the most because he is colorful and I like his jacket and hair style - looks very much like a video game style dealer."
176,Male,$31-60k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,"Based on the description of how he likes to enjoy himself in the strip club, is smart, and has a sense of humor, I think C is the best option. Based on the outfit and the fact that C has a drink in his hand shows me he likes to have fun."
177,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,C seems most like a normal guy which I think is the character you want. He also seems the most timeless a figure.
178,Male,$101k+,Hispanic,Graduate Degree,25-34,,,C looks much tougher and like a drug dealer since it has camo clothing.  B has a jacket that looks like money which fits the drug dealer look. A looks like a nerdy kid trying to be cool
179,Male,$101k+,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,,,I ranked my choices based on my preferences for outfits - which one looked the most like the character described in the background information.
180,Male,$31-60k,White,Graduate Degree,45-54,,,"The character seems more comic relief than scary drug dealer. As Option A looks the silliest, goofiest, I__ stick with this Jonah Hill type."
181,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,I think c looks like the description the most followed by b. A not so much
182,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,,,"C looks like the laid back drug dealer who might have some real good stuff and would be fun to talk to.  B look like he would be fun and sometimes serious, but still good to work with. A looks like an undercover cop and not fun."
183,Male,$61-100k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,I was looking at the face in the ranking. Option C looks the friendliest yet sleazy at the same time. Option A looked like he can be crazy. Option B looks like he doesn't care attitude.
184,Male,$31-60k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,I felt that C fit the description the best because C's facial expression gave off some intelligence versus the other two which fits the being person being smart in the description.
185,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,"If he's ready to try new and exciting things in the strip club, I'd assume he's adventurous with his clothing too. Option A's lime green fits that the best. Plus, he looks the smartest in it. In Option C, he looks too goofy."
186,Male,$0-30k,White,High School,25-34,,,A is the one that looks the most thug like and I think that B follows in its footsteps. I also like C but feel that one is less intimidating.
187,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,I ranked by how intimidating they looked. Option B doesn't look intimidating. Option A looks like he could turn on you at any moment. C looks more laid back.
188,Male,$0-30k,White,High School,35-44,,,choice A has more general expierence and a more fuller personality
189,Male,$0-30k,Hispanic,Vocational Training,25-34,,,"This character looks the biggest douche to me, so I have to rank him the highest."
190,Male,$61-100k,White,High School,45-54,,,"I think the character in choice C is the best representation of this character, the clothing is slightly upscale, the person has a somewhat care free expression on his face, but he doesn't look like he is too hardened or too tough, in other words he doesn't look like a full on drug lord. The character in option B is much the same way, he is dressed somewhat nicely but doesn't have that ""hardened"" look to him."
191,Male,$101k+,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,,,I prefer option A because the bright colors really help him stand out and make it more visually appealing.
192,Male,$101k+,White,Graduate Degree,45-54,,,"I believe this is the best option because the character's image is a good mix of friendly and edgy. A good drug dealer needs to be friendly enough to make the sale, but also have an air of authority around them - which this person seems to do. The image that I ranked last is quite bad - it does not fit the persona at all."
193,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,,,"I voted for option C because I find him completely believable, he reminds me of someone I had met at a party back in college and fits the description to a T, so I find that a believable choice."
194,Male,$31-60k,Other,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,"I chose option 3, because it fits the description of someone with a sense of humor that spends a lot of money in strip clubs.  He is dressed in a manner that you'd expect someone who hangs out in strip clubs to look.  Option B was my second choice. While that design does not really fit the strip club as much, the outfit helps emphasize the sense of humor.  Option A was the last, because it looks more generic, and does not really fit the description presented."
195,Male,$0-30k,White,Graduate Degree,25-34,,,"option C is too friendly for a drug dealer, he is even kid-friendly. Option B reflects his sense of humor but you can also see the toughness of a drug dealer"
196,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,35-44,,,I think the darker less showy colors would attract less attention like a real drug dealer.
197,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,45-54,,,"A really has the vibe of something who is doing his own thing and likes to get crazy. I think it has more to do with the style of clothing than anything else. He just looks like doesn't care about anyone elses opinions of him. B kind of fits that role but the clothing just feels like he is playing the part and not embracing who he really is. C just looks like someone who is trying to be someone he is not, and completely does not fit the description."
198,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,45-54,,,The style in C is simple but still portrays a lavish spender who could easily switch up as a ruthless drug lord.
199,Male,$61-100k,White,Associate Degree,35-44,,,I like option A because the character is dressed more to impress others.
200,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Role Playing; Strategy; Puzzle; Adventure; Action,,I feel like practical clothing would fit best with the theme.
201,Male,$0-30k,Hispanic,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Sports; Adventure; Action,,"H I feel is the best design because I feel that a more realistic approach to the design is much more fitting, and also it looks a lot better without it being overdone."
202,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Sports; Strategy; Arcade; Adventure; Action,,the character in option C is the most attractive to me because it looks the most relevant to this type of game
203,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Sports; Role Playing; Arcade; Adventure; Action,,"Option D is the most attractive choice. The character gives off a look of confidence, and her appearance is more on the natural side. The red hair is not as common for a main character, so she would have a unique, easy to remember vibe about her. The outfit is eye catching as well."
204,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Word; Puzzle; Family; Educational; Card,,I PREFER E TO ALL OTHER OPTIONS BECAUSE SHE LOOKS BEAVE AND TERRIFIC AND I HAVE A HOPE ON HER.
205,Male,$61-100k,Black,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Adventure; Action; Role Playing; Strategy; Simulation,,I like option D the best because I like the way she is dressed and she looks like she is a hardened fighter.
206,Male,$0-30k,White,High School,25-34,Action; Adventure; Puzzle; Word; Music,,"B, the character looks very detailed and as if they have had an experience in the world. It makes me feel very interested.D, the character has physically attractive attributes, and also looks fairly realistic and as if they have been in the world.A, the character looks fairly realistic, however I dislike the shoes, they make the character look as if they have really large feet.E, this character has physically attractive traits, and the clothing look worn and used as if in the world.H, I find this character looks very realistic, however also very boring and simple. Their clothes have dirt and makes it look used, however they just look very basic, nothing stands out as special or attractive.G, This character has unrealistic attributes that while are attractive, is not as realistic and makes me much less interested.F, I find the clothing that this character wearing very attractive, however also not at all realistic for a post-apocalyptic world, where there would probably be fighting.C, This character looks very interesting, however also extremely unrealistic, and it makes me much less interested."
207,Male,$61-100k,Other,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Strategy; Simulation; Role Playing; Puzzle; Educational,,"I hate fantasy, sexual, and futuristic stuff for future events. Zombie apocalypse would pause world technological progress and so [A], [F], and [C] are terribly bad. the ankle bracelet on [B] needs to be removed. [H] is by far the ONLY acceptable choice here for me. [G] is perfect dark. [E] looks happy and sexually posing for no reason. [F] is just cyber punk 2077. [D] is barbarian germanic gothic with samurai swords for NO reason. In short, almost all of these were bad. But my preferences stand strong as-is."
208,Male,$31-60k,White,Graduate Degree,25-34,Adventure; Arcade; Board; Sports; Strategy,,I think the creativity of the designs and the intensity of the characters is most represented in this order. I like the sleek looks that feature some cool gadgets.
209,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Trivia; Puzzle; Educational; Board; Action,,"not a huge fan of the last one.  the ones that i like are generally brunette, i just think it looks better than the stereotypical blonde. i also like the ones that are a bit more clothed, i think you selling the character, not only sexualizing them. the last one is hard to tell what's going on and the gun is way too large.  my number 1 and 2 both have a nice adventure theme to them and remind me a bit of things like tomb raider. 3 is great but a bit too tight pants - ha, awesome though. 4 is awesome looking, but the legs are a bit skinny and she looks too much like a barbie doll. 5 is your typical type cop, although not too much sexualized about her body, she has a beautiful face though."
210,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,Family; Puzzle; Action; Role Playing; Strategy,,"C is not attractive at all and just is not remotely realistic. F looks like a female caricature of a punk female from the early 2010's. B is hard to make out and I don't like the mask. H is practical, realistic and kind of boring. G is really attractive but not at all realistic. A is really realistic and kind of exciting but not quite as attractive as some of the others. D and E are really close with E being the preferred fighting partner."
211,Male,$0-30k,White,Associate Degree,45-54,Strategy; Word; Trivia; Puzzle; Card,,"My choices were ranked by how useful, comfortable and pragmatic the outfit would be for me in a world that is described as the one above.  How sexy the outfit appeared had no bearing on my choices, but rather like my first choice I chose an ensemble in which i could actually battle the zombies, be comfortable in my attire and not have to worry about clothing that could possibly get in the way of those goals.  My choices after that were based on the same criteria, with my last ranking going to the one with the most equipment to have to carry and the most impractical attire.  I couldn't imagine having to do battle in this attire for I would tire very fast and would most likely be taken out by the zombies fairly quickly."
212,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,35-44,Simulation; Puzzle; Card; Board; Adventure,,She is extremely attractive and has clothes on that would match the theme that the game is portraying. She also has weapons and is ready to battle and fight any zombie that she would encounter along the way.
213,Male,$101k+,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Word; Strategy; Role Playing; Adventure; Action,,"For a post apocalyptic world, E is my favorite. There's a grittiness and determination in the character that the others seem to lack. B comes a close second but the character has a more innocent feeling to her. H is interesting as it fits in the environment pretty well. D, F and G feel so out of place and fits more of a fantasy game than this one. C seems so out of place in any world."
214,Male,$0-30k,White,High School,35-44,Word; Trivia; Racing; Card; Arcade,,"choices e,d,g have more of a simple and attractive appearance"
215,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Action,,"If it's a matter of pure attraction, then E takes the cake. You want the character to be young and flashy. They have to stand out. I believe that E is the most conventionally attractive, with the dark hair, idealized face and features, and the unusual pose with the gun. D would have to be second. I put B third because that is a similar character, but the red hair is an additional highlight. The remaining ones are a bit more covered up or even generic to me. Like I think G and A have a certain level of fakery to me that doesn't make them as appealing of characters as the ones before, and F is very similar, too exaggerated. H is rather plain and normal and C is just weird. If you're looking for attractiveness only, E is the optimal choice."
216,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Action; Adventure; Strategy; Trivia; Word,,Choice D would be most attractive to me. Her face is beautiful and she is not to skinny. She looks strong and confident
217,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Arcade; Casino; Puzzle; Sports; Word,,"D is the sexiest and hottest.  The outfit is very sexy.  The fishnets , belly shirt, and cleavage are great in the outfit."
218,Male,$31-60k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Strategy; Action; Adventure; Arcade; Role Playing,,"I like the purple and blue color scheme of my top choice, which is striking and caught my eye. The simplicity of the design of my second choice is also nice. Very cool set overall!"
219,Male,$61-100k,White,High School,25-34,Music,,I chose the way I did because tighter clothing is more attractive. F and G had the tightest clothing and were very attractive. C was last because it wasn't attractive at all.
220,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Strategy; Puzzle; Adventure,,I really like option E because she looks flawless. I think she has a great body and I really like her grey shirt.  She's a total babe and a badass.
221,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Casino; Puzzle; Trivia,,I like having some sexual element to the character and I think E and D do a good job of adding that but still making the character look like they might belong in this setting. I like the swords that D has and the weapons in E. I feel C is just too much and too weapons focused. I like the G is too much focused on the sex appeal however but she does look good. I don't care for the hair in B and the cop in H looks nice but doesn't give me a zombie feel to her.
222,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Adventure; Casino; Music; Sports,,Option H is my top choice for the character in this particular game because she looks like all-business with her boring police uniform but you can tell that she is sexy underneath but it is more subtle than the others.
223,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,Card; Board; Racing; Puzzle; Adventure,,The most important thing is to the game characters should be created with the sequences of realistic character sets. The realistic theme will helps the user to make a more gameplay and usage with the certain apps. And the theme characters will helps to reach peoples easily.
224,Male,$61-100k,Asian,Graduate Degree,25-34,Word; Trivia; Puzzle; Arcade; Action,,"Honestly, the only character who makes practical sense in a zombie apocalypse is Option H, since she's in practical attire (a police officer's uniform) and has her hair tied up so that it's less likely to be grabbed. All the other designs are highly impractical for an apocalyptic situation, as they generally lean on the ""sexier"" side."
225,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,Strategy; Simulation; Role Playing,,I see this image as being the most realistic look in a dystopian future setting. I like the gas mask to help her breathe. I like the ripped fishnet stockings. I also like how her gun looks homemade as well as the way she wears in on her hip.
226,Male,$0-30k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Role Playing; Strategy,,Options B and H are less demeaning to women as objects.
227,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Puzzle; Sports; Strategy,,I think D has the sexiest look of all the characters and I like that her main weapon is not a gun because it shows she is confident and athletic.
228,Male,$61-100k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Strategy; Role Playing,,I liked choice E since the character looks attractive and confident. Choice H looks plain and unappealing with a police outfit.
229,Male,$61-100k,Other,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Adventure,,"I most prefer option D with option G being slightly behind. These are the two females that just seem most sexy to me. The outfits may really play a part, but i think most of it has to do with their body."
230,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,25-34,Word; Strategy; Trivia,,B is the most attractive to me because she has a certain innocence to her appearance as well as a sense of mystery.  I also thought E looked very attractive due to her smile and facial expression.
231,Male,$61-100k,Hispanic,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Strategy; Sports; Action; Role Playing; Racing,,Love her face as it is very attractive in an unassuming way. Her hairstyle matches her entire look very well. Her outfit is very sexy as well. I also like how she is carrying her arsenal of weapons. You can tell by her look that she means business. Very attractive woman that is going to put you in your place if you step to her the wrong way.
232,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,35-44,Action; Adventure; Role Playing; Simulation; Strategy,,"F is very attractive and looks cool/ badass. E and D are really close and i like them both equally, G is okay but reminds me too much of black widow.  A dn H look more like background characters. the rest I do not like"
233,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Word; Puzzle; Strategy; Adventure; Action,,"i like this order, i dont want too much of a polished up girl, i mean most of them are a little too sexy for a zombie game but there is army sexy vs dancer sexy"
234,Male,$61-100k,Asian,Graduate Degree,25-34,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Racing; Sports,,I ranked the designs of the female character for a video game that I liked the most.  I found the design of option G the most followed by the design of option D followed by option F followed by option E then option B then option A.  I then liked option H and then finally option C
235,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Casino; Trivia; Word; Action; Arcade,,"H clearly has nice features, but they're hidden inside her uniform.  She is very realistic of a pretty cop-woman.  E on the other hand is a hot model with very nice features which are not hidden."
236,Male,$31-60k,White,Graduate Degree,25-34,Action; Adventure; Card; Puzzle; Strategy,,"I made my ranking decisions based on which characters had the most confident stances. In addition, I also tried to think of what a character would look like that best fit into a zombie style game."
237,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Trivia; Card; Casino; Sports,,i like the cyber punk look. i think she stands out the most. i would definitely want to play around with her
238,Male,$101k+,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Arcade; Action; Adventure,,I prefer character H because she has the most realistic character that came out of the real world into the post apocalyptic world and became a game character.
239,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Casino; Adventure; Racing; Sports; Word,,I like option D the best because the character looks the most attractive and stands out the most to me.
240,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,35-44,Adventure; Simulation; Strategy; Trivia; Role Playing,,"I think G is the most attractive, I like the hair, breasts and body on her the most.  Her face is pleasant as well"
241,Male,$0-30k,White,High School,35-44,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Role Playing; Puzzle,,"G and F are far too clean and shiny for the setting. Plus, with how tight those outfits are, they will be bait in more than one way. So they are out right at the start. C could work, but feels too sci-fi and busy. He feels more at home on a starship as a boarding team. H is great for early game, before things completely fall apart... although I doubt things would stay that way for long. I do like the more basic designs for this though. The rest are mostly tied, but fail in one detail. Too clean. The world is rough, they don't have time for wash, rinse, repeat. B is the best in showing the world is rough and dirty now."
242,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Music; Puzzle; Sports,,"The most attractive character to me is the one in Image G, because she looks very fierce, confident and like slayer. Image D looks great too and has most of the characters listen above so that's my second choice!"
243,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Action; Puzzle; Trivia; Strategy,,"I like the ones that seem less sexualized, there's absolutely no point to skimpy clothing and tits showing"
244,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Trivia; Strategy,,I think that option F is the most unique and creative character design.  I really like the colors and it makes me more likely to play as this character.
245,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Adventure; Arcade; Casino; Sports; Trivia,,"Option F seems unique and has a certain allure that the other choices lack. I prefer option F by a large margin. Options G, B, and E all seem suitable for the description, and I would be happy with any of these as well. Options H and D seem to lack the verve and excitement of the others, and options A and C just seem like they don't fit the idea nearly as well."
246,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Strategy; Simulation,,"I like H the most, I am most interested in realistic games and having the female officer is a good look and I think helps the game the most. She seems interesting to play and would give good realism. The guns on C just seems fun, it is such an out there design I think it would be entertaining to play. The rest are all fairly good, nothing was really bad but they did not catch my interest the same as H."
247,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Adventure; Strategy; Role Playing; Simulation,,I love H and how real she looks. It looks like photo of a real cop. It is the only one I like out of all of these. I have been spoiled by good graphic games and I would not play one that does not have it.
248,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Action; Casino; Role Playing; Simulation; Sports,,"I'd rather have big guns and more fun instead of the sexy women. Yes, I get it, sexy women. I'd rather have a game with fun gameplay and cool weapons though."
249,Male,$101k+,White,Graduate Degree,25-34,Puzzle; Role Playing; Adventure,,"I think all of these options are terrible, the female characters are all too hyper-sexualized, while the option C looks ridiculous"
250,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,25-34,Action; Casino; Arcade; Trivia,,"I think option D is the most attractive, I like her dark hair, her short shorts, she is fully decked out with weapons."
251,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,Role Playing; Sports; Action,,Although the others might be considered physically attractive (besides C).  I feel that H is more realistic and therefore more attractive for this sort of game.
252,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Simulation; Action; Family; Strategy; Racing,,"I voted first based on the character's physical appearance, and in situations where there was a tie, i took the weaponry they were holding as the tie breaker."
253,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Casino; Adventure; Strategy,,I like the realistic models the most. It makes the game more relatable and 'sexier' if you're going for that appeal
254,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,Music; Strategy; Word,,"D resonates with me most. I love the brunette hair and the outfit is nicely detailed. She looks menacing yet beautiful. Also, I love her stockings -- nice sexy touch."
255,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Strategy; Word,,C is kinda weird and f and a are too immodest. The others are cool and seem modern and trendy to me
256,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Strategy; Trivia,,I ranked my choices based on my physical attraction to the character.
257,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Simulation; Sports; Action; Role Playing,,I really enjoy zombie shooting games. I think the character in C would be the most appealing to me as I think the Gatling gun looks really cool and would be the most fun to play with.
258,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Strategy; Sports; Racing,,"the hotter the better, although C is pretty wicked"
259,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,Sports; Strategy; Racing,,I'd have to go with C because this character is equipped and ready to go. It looks like I'd be able to get somewhere in the game with this character.
260,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,Action; Arcade; Role Playing; Strategy; Word,,I like the rugged dress best over the tight fitting outfits of the characters.  Sexy is good but maybe not in this game.
261,Male,$0-30k,White,High School,25-34,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Music; Puzzle,,"I picked G, F, D and A as my top choices as the designs of the girls look very beautiful to play in the game I picked C as my least favorite as the character design looks too bulky."
262,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Action; Adventure; Role Playing; Strategy; Simulation,,having some sex appeal with some cleavage will get players more engaged and excited
263,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Strategy; Arcade; Puzzle; Trivia; Simulation,,"Anyone who says they're not a fan of curves is a liar. The first few ranked choices definitely seem to have a lot of personality that comes out through their attire. In the middle the choices are almost bordering on ""too young"" looking. Then there are a few with a Laura Croft-esque look to them which is still good. The only couple I didn't really like were the last two, with the cop, and the one that's practically a mech with all those guns."
264,Male,$0-30k,White,High School,25-34,Trivia; Action; Puzzle; Strategy,,"I preferred the most realistic designs in this game's theme and setting over the more fantastical ones displayed above. H, E, and to an extent G seem like something a real person would actually be wearing in a setting like this. The others seem to gravitate towards more overly sexualized tones or just over the top fantastical tones."
265,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Word,,The only character I was not a fan of was my last choice.  I want a human-looking character.  All of the others fit that description.
266,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Strategy; Role Playing; Simulation; Action; Adventure,,It is the posture and the swords.  THey both give her the personality of being both sassy and dangerous
267,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,45-54,Trivia; Sports; Racing; Puzzle; Action,,"The dress in A is attractive, the character is well equipped to survive and the character looks well energetic to run around. I like the style in D but not armed enough bodily. The style in C possess a lot of firepowers but that could slow the character down."
268,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Board; Trivia; Simulation; Role Playing,,This model is the most attractive because of the cleavage and what she wears
269,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Strategy; Trivia; Word; Role Playing; Puzzle,,"The lady in option D looks the most interesting and lively. I like her personality, the dual kitanas and her large breasts. E would be next because of her smile and her overall personality. B would be third because I like her hair and the wastelander theme. H would be fourth because I like the idea of a cop still in uniform. It shows her dedication. F looks kind of ridiculous with the bright colors to me and A just doesn__ appeal to me at all because it seems generic. I don__ care for G or C which is very bizarre looking."
270,Male,$101k+,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Arcade; Puzzle; Action,,"A lot of choices. C was just weird and cool so I liked that one. I then went by character model with coolness and sexiness being my goal. D,E,F,G,A are all pretty equal to me. My rank is probably based upon style. H feels realistic, but not as much fun in a game. I really did not like B. It had a mix of sexiness and coolness that the others had, but I just didn't like it. It might be the mask or the younger girl aesthetic that doesn't work for me."
271,Male,$0-30k,White,High School,25-34,Simulation; Sports,,"My first option would be G as I enjoy the white hair and the illustrative style used to draw them. I would follow this up with F because of their colorful costume and haircut and then D because of their red hair and blue jacket. I would say the next most visually appealing is E because I like how they are designed with their brown costume followed by H and A, H for how well rendered they are and A for their white hair. I would count B as looking too young to be appealing and C as looking kind of weird with their weapons and headgear."
272,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Adventure; Puzzle; Role Playing; Strategy,,I chose option B as my favorite because I think the costume/outfit fits in the most with the post-apocolyptic theme of the game.  If I was playing a game like that this is the character that I would be attracted to playing
273,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,35-44,Casino; Adventure; Arcade; Action; Role Playing,,My top pick works best by far because it's the most realistic depiction of a post apocalyptic survivor.
274,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Adventure; Arcade; Puzzle; Role Playing; Strategy,,"My top choices are what I most envision when imagining a post-apocalyptic character. G looks better suited for space, and C looks like something out of the Cyber Punk world. I think post apocalyptic would looks mostly like normal people more dirty that usual as well as having their close more tattered"
275,Male,$31-60k,Asian,Graduate Degree,25-34,Trivia; Strategy; Simulation; Role Playing; Action,,"I choose D because the graphic design of the main character is visually attractive and appealing, compared to other options"
276,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Board; Simulation; Strategy; Puzzle; Role Playing,,"F and G are the only ones I really like at all because the colors they have in their design are bold and not so muted, and the designs itself look nice whereas the others look kind of generic to me"
277,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Role Playing; Simulation; Strategy; Sports; Action,,"Even though it is a fantasy world, I would want some realism. The policewoman looks like was a cop before the apocalypse and E,D and B look like they kind of turned into that version of themself due to survival. The others are a little too fantasy like."
278,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Arcade; Puzzle; Word; Educational,,The favorite choice looks more prepared for battle and looks like she has had some battle experience already
279,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,35-44,Board; Card; Word,,"A few of the designs are just a bit too generic as far as overall theme goes... I like F and C a lot as the more original ones. C definitely the most unique, F probably has the most style."
280,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Trivia; Action; Adventure; Puzzle; Sports,,Attractiveness in this scenario is a pretty face and visible curves. E d and g all have that. A has the curves but not the face. F has the face but not the curves. B and h have neither. And what the heck is c?
281,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,Simulation,,Brunettes are usually natural and I am not sure when in an apocalyptic future someone would have time to bleach their hair.  D and E also have outfits that are sexy and realistic in terms of limited resources.
282,Male,$31-60k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Action; Adventure; Role Playing; Simulation; Strategy,,"The more natural looking is the best, because that's what we want to see in video games, more natural and realistic people wearing normal stuff."
283,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,45-54,Puzzle; Music; Action,,"Well, I ranked them by how attractive they are in such a game and how well they looked like they would fit in that world.  H, F, and (to some extent) G don't even really fit in that world, to me.  B and E were the best because they have the right look and appear as if they could kick butt.  The styling really works.  I like the weapon C has...some of the weapons don't really work in such a world and I ranked keeping that in mind as well.  Beyond that, it's about the way they are drawn."
284,Male,$31-60k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Action; Card; Role Playing,,I like the women that have swords the most. I like H the least because it just looks like a generic policewoman. C is also a bit weird and doesn't really fit in with the rest.
285,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Strategy; Sports; Racing; Adventure; Action,,"I think that options E, G, and D are by far the most attractive characters out of the eight options. However, I think that option E is the most attractive, primarily due to the seductive look on her face."
286,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Card; Casino; Arcade; Word; Puzzle,,I really voted for the most life like and the most attractive avatar and put them in order.
287,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Word; Sports; Action,,"Option H is my choice as it is visibly feminine yet not overtly sexualized. The realism is helpful to set the tone for the game, as in it gives the sense it is believable progression towards what would happen after society falls apart. The others are just more sexualized versions of what is available today so they don't add anything new to the genre."
288,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Adventure; Strategy; Casino; Role Playing; Trivia,,"To start, I really don't like my bottom two options as they are boring and just don't excite me. I really like my top three choices as they all look tough and really grab the eye. The more intense the better in my opinion."
289,Male,$0-30k,White,Graduate Degree,25-34,Action; Arcade; Sports,,I feel like this character is most attractive and lends itself well to the nature of the genre.
290,Male,$0-30k,White,High School,35-44,Puzzle; Role Playing; Strategy; Sports; Simulation,,"This would be my choice order pretty much based on boobs and butts but G, is my #1 pick not only for her great boobs but attractiveness and sex appeal"
291,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Simulation; Action; Puzzle; Racing; Strategy,,"The top ranked choices feel most unique, interesting, cool or new. The lowest ranked ones seem generic or boring, expected"
292,Male,$101k+,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Puzzle; Board; Card; Strategy; Trivia,,I ranked my choices based on which woman was the most scantily clad.
293,Male,$101k+,White,Graduate Degree,45-54,Puzzle; Word; Strategy,,"Nothing quite like a girl in a uniform, H is realistic and attractive.  B has a cyber punk look I kind of like.  D and E remind me of Keira Knightly (sp?).  G is pretty and curvy.  F is cute enough, I like the red hair.  A is a little cartoonish compared to the other ladies.  WTH is C supposed to be?   If it was a realistic soldier, I'd probably rank it higher, but it looks ridiculous."
294,Male,$0-30k,White,High School,35-44,Arcade; Racing; Puzzle; Trivia; Sports,,"Options H and B stand out to me first. They both look like ""survivors"" rather than just characters. When I see them and read the description they're the two that ""fit"" the theme for me and would be the most attractive to play."
295,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Simulation,,"Options B and H are more realistic and not overly sexualized (with fairly unreasonable proportions like E, A, G, F and D). Option C is just too odd. In general, there is no need to make gaming women super sexy and with massive breasts or perfect backsides."
296,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Card; Role Playing; Adventure,,I like E because the way she is standing. I like G because of the open jacket. I like F  because of her hips showing towards the viewer. I like D  because of the shorts. I like B because of the hair style. I like A  because of their hair style. I like H because of the uniform. I like C because of the bullets.
297,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Board; Card; Racing; Puzzle,,"I think option F is extremely attractive. She has a perfect face, cool hair, and an amazing body."
298,Male,$31-60k,Asian,Graduate Degree,25-34,Adventure; Music; Role Playing,,Option B was my first choice because I thought that character's outfit best fits the concept of a post-apocalyptic setting as described in the prompt. Option D was my second choice because that outfit also fit the described setting but not as much as the outfit in option B. Option G was my third choice because I thought that overall design was good but it didn't exactly fit the described setting of the game. Option E was my fourth choice because it was similar to the design in option G but I felt it was trying too hard to be sexy. Option H was my fifth choice because that design was decent but somewhat plain compared to the other designs. Option F was my sixth choice because that was a good design generally speaking but it felt like it didn't belong in the game as described in the prompt and would be a better fit in a game like Cyberpunk 2077. Option A was my seventh choice because it was rather generic but still had some appealing points. Option C was my last choice because that character felt overdesigned and I don't like that the character's face isn't seen.
299,Male,$0-30k,White,High School,25-34,Arcade; Card; Educational; Strategy; Puzzle,,"I am a fan of outrageous over design and characters looking really cool and defying reality, so the guy with the huge gun and magazine seen in choice C is attention grabbing as a character"
300,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Word; Puzzle; Family; Educational; Card,,I PREFER A BECAUSE IT HAS A MORE CHANCE.
301,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,65+,Educational; Adventure; Action; Strategy; Word,,"I prefer B.  The colors are more vivid in B, especially the blue of the sky."
302,Male,$0-30k,Hispanic,High School,25-34,Role Playing; Adventure; Action,,Option B has the castle in the back a reasonable level. My only complaint of this is that the middle and right cliffs should be raised a bit more on B.
303,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Simulation,,I prefer option A because the lack of the weird outline on the trees makes this look much more realistic.
304,Male,$0-30k,Other,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Role Playing; Puzzle,,A has a more realistic look to it. B looks fake but maybe on purpose?
305,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,45-54,Puzzle; Casino; Role Playing; Simulation,,I feel the outlining of the play area/background setting makes the actual gameplay area stand apart and it feel more active and easier to focus on for gameplay. I think it also gives the graphics a sharper and more professional feel.
306,Male,$31-60k,White,Graduate Degree,25-34,Adventure; Puzzle; Arcade,,I like the coloration. It just feels more realistic which brings me into the game more because it feels like somewhere I could really visit and experience.
307,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Sports; Strategy; Arcade; Adventure; Action,,i think option B is more appealing to me because you can see the characters more clearly

310,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Puzzle,,I think option A with the building more prominently displayed higher up is more visually appealing. The other option looks really fake with the building behind the trees.
311,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Sports; Adventure; Trivia; Simulation; Board,,"I like the naturalness of option A a bit more as the trees are not outlined like that in option B. It just looks more legitimate and artsy, in my opinion."
312,Male,$31-60k,Black,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Puzzle; Strategy; Role Playing; Adventure; Action,,"I like the paper cut out look with the outlines on the trees, it is very stylish."
313,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Trivia; Card; Casino; Sports,,I like the lighter looking background. It's easier to see.
314,Male,$61-100k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Strategy; Role Playing,,I liked choice A since the lighting of the game looks more realistic and grabs my interest right away. Choice B has darker shading and doesn't look as detailed.
315,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Adventure; Casino; Music; Sports,,Option A is more appealing to me because the shooting angles are more interesting and challenging.
316,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Arcade; Casino; Puzzle; Sports; Word,,A Is a little better because I can see the castle in the background more clearly. This is an attractive eye-catching picture
317,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Puzzle; Strategy,,"Option A just seems a little more realistic to me and thus, is a little bit better quality than the alternative."
318,Male,$31-60k,White,Graduate Degree,25-34,Adventure; Arcade; Board; Sports; Strategy,,I like the contrast of the colors a little bit. This looks more vibrant compared to the other.
319,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,55-64,Family; Arcade; Card,,I prefer this option.  The trees and distant mountains look much better in this option. I like the contrast better too.
320,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,Family; Puzzle; Action; Role Playing; Strategy,,I much prefer the style and design of A over B.
321,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Music; Puzzle; Sports,,This looks more appealing.
322,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Trivia; Puzzle; Educational; Board; Action,,I like the one without the rocks behind the opponent I think it's easier to see them
323,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Adventure; Board; Card; Casino,,I like choice A better because the lighting highlights more the center of the feature.
324,Male,$101k+,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Adventure; Puzzle,,Choice A has more realistic backgrounds. Choice B's backgrounds look like they are artificial or made from paper mache.

326,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Action; Adventure; Strategy; Trivia; Word,,The more subtle shadowing in B looks more realistic and better. Why is it so dramatic in choice A? That__ a bit distracting
327,Male,$0-30k,White,High School,25-34,Action; Adventure; Puzzle; Word; Music,,"I find the art style, and the lighting/shading makes it look much more appealing, the shadows around the edges make it have depth that makes the characters and objects ""pop"" out. I find the art style fitting for the style of lighting."
328,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Adventure; Strategy; Role Playing,,The shadows of B feel a little more natural.

330,Male,$61-100k,Black,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Adventure; Action; Role Playing; Strategy; Simulation,,I like option B the best because I like that there isn't much vegetation or background scenery behind where the two characters are standing.
331,Male,$61-100k,Asian,Graduate Degree,25-34,Word; Trivia; Puzzle; Arcade; Action,,"I prefer Option A since the trees seem to fit in the landscape better. In Option B, the outline makes the trees stand out too much and makes the experience less immersive."
332,Male,$0-30k,White,Associate Degree,35-44,Action; Puzzle; Strategy,,I pick A because of the more realistic look of the background and outside the game. I feel B looks like it__ made of paper and not as realistic as B looks.
333,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Adventure; Puzzle; Card; Action; Strategy,,I like the 2D look of the game in B better.  I think going for a stylized look in your game is a good thing.  There are so many generic 3D games.
334,Male,$31-60k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Strategy; Action; Adventure; Arcade; Role Playing,,"I like the higher height of the tree and building in this option, which add a nice accent to the image. Very cool for sure!"
335,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,Card; Board; Racing; Puzzle; Adventure,,I like the theme in the option A webpage. It was to good and the quality of the theme was really awesome. Players will definitely choose this to their priority game playlists.
336,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Casino; Puzzle; Trivia,,I don't like how the trees look like cutout props in B. I like the look of the landscape much better in A.

339,Male,$0-30k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Role Playing; Strategy,,Option A of a shadow cast creates a sense of mystery and challenges that could happen.
340,Male,$61-100k,Other,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Adventure,,"I find option B most appealing to me. The images are super similar, so i would really go with either one though. The castle on the hill really doesnt make a huge difference to me."
341,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Puzzle; Sports; Strategy,,I think A looks a little more natural because the trees in the background don't have the white border.
342,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,35-44,Action; Adventure; Role Playing; Simulation; Strategy,,"I like this more, the other has those weird outlines that just give it a weird sort of look I do not care for"
343,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,25-34,Word; Strategy; Trivia,,I liked B more because the shadows seemed more balanced and less distracting. The entire scene felt much brighter and clearer because of it.
344,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Adventure; Simulation; Puzzle,,The realistic shadow lighting is a lot more immersive in video games
345,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,45-54,Word,,The highlighted edges of the elements in B look very odd. Those highlights are distracting visually. A looks much more natural overall. A is best for sure.
346,Male,$61-100k,White,Vocational Training,25-34,Action; Adventure; Role Playing; Simulation,,I like the castle and the shadows added more in Option A. It makes the image feel more complete and full. The trees look off in Option B

348,Male,$61-100k,Hispanic,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Strategy; Sports; Action; Role Playing; Racing,,I like the colors and details of the background in this one much more than the other one. The other one just looks too fake with those colors and rigid lines on the trees leaves.
349,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Sports; Adventure; Strategy; Role Playing,,I think the lighting in A looks a bit more natural and less confusing. I especially do not like the shadows under the concrete in B given the flat art style. I think the lighting in A is entirely more consistent with the art style. I also hate the stroking effect around the vegetation in B.
350,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,Puzzle; Action; Adventure; Strategy; Music,,C because of the shadowing which makes it more realistic of a feel.

356,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,25-34,Strategy; Word; Puzzle; Action,,I would pick B and C as my top picks because the scenery just looks a bit cleaner. I wasn't a fan of the enlarged cannon in option A so I rated it last. But truthfully they're all really similar and I'm not sure anyone would really care for the small differences.
357,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,35-44,Simulation; Puzzle; Card; Board; Adventure,,Either of the first 2 is fine. I don't really care for the heavy shadows and textures on the third one.
358,Male,$0-30k,Hispanic,High School,25-34,Role Playing; Adventure; Action,,"I like the style on option C since it looks more clear and crisp. Option B is alright, although the trees look very simple. Option A looks like a blurry mess."

361,Male,$61-100k,Black,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Adventure; Racing; Strategy; Action; Simulation,,"In my opinion, Option C is the best looking representation out of the three choices. Option C looks a lot more detailed and realistic compared to the other choices."
362,Male,$61-100k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Strategy; Role Playing,,I liked choice C and how realistic the image looks and the way the shading is very dramatic. Choice B looks a bit off and not as eye catching with the color scheme.
363,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Racing; Strategy; Action; Adventure; Role Playing,,I think C feels like it has the most depth and more realism. It seems more pleasing to the eye because of the lighting on the obstacles.

365,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Arcade; Strategy; Trivia; Role Playing; Simulation,,"I like the bright green and vivid colors the most in Option B, as they allow you to see everything clearly. Option C is too muted."

369,Male,$0-30k,Hispanic,Less than High School Diploma,25-34,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Role Playing; Simulation,,"C is best because the lighting ads an extra feeling of quality thats not seen in the others. B is next because the textured rock looks much better than the not textured one, and A is last because it looks lower in quality than the others."
370,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Adventure; Board; Card; Casino,,Choice C brightens the light in the critical region of the game.  It is easier to see.

373,Male,$31-60k,White,Graduate Degree,25-34,Adventure; Puzzle; Arcade,,I like the brighter coloration the most because it feels like it could be the most real and I'm actually somewhere in they daytime. The moody shadows also look pretty nice but I feel like it's slightly less engaging just because I'm not as likely to be there.
374,Male,$61-100k,White,Associate Degree,35-44,Puzzle; Trivia,,I like option A because with the lighter background you can see the main game play better.

384,Male,$0-30k,White,High School,35-44,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Role Playing; Puzzle,,"The watercolor artstyle of the main characters remain pretty consistent between the three. What stands out is the world they're in. The brighter blocks of the level and the trees makes the world pop a bit more.

405,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Adventure; Card; Role Playing; Strategy,,"I really like the first one the most, the others look pretty good as well"
406,Male,$31-60k,Black,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Puzzle; Strategy; Role Playing; Adventure; Action,,"Options A,E and F are good names that stick with you, simple names that don't come off complicated. Options B,D and C are ok, not that strong of names though."
407,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Action,,"The title should be unique but representative of the setting, which is post-apocalyptic. I feel like entropy signifies that, and the year 2063 shows you that it is in the future. Without knowing anything more about the plot, this name is perfect and doesn't remind me of any other game. I think D is close because it is also unique, but it isn't as descript. C is similar. E is good but it is too similar to the existing Exodus series, which could cause confusion. A and B are too plain or nondescript to me."
408,Male,$61-100k,Black,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Adventure; Action; Role Playing; Strategy; Simulation,,"I like option D the best because ""Project Nostos"" has a nice sound to it and it also has a meaning surrounding it due to the word ""Nostos"", which means a hero returning to his home or homeland."
409,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Board; Sports,,Option D is my choice because the name represents well  the games' plot.
410,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Strategy; Trivia; Word; Role Playing; Puzzle,,Option E has a great sound to it. Exodus sounds biblical and sci fi. F would be next because I like the word Entropy. A would be third because Earth War stands out and has a good ring to it. D sounds original and caught my eye more than C and B which I don__ really care for at all as they sound boring and generic to me.
411,Male,$0-30k,Hispanic,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Sports; Adventure; Action,,A I feel has a name that is able to mesh well with the design and description the best to me.
412,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,35-44,Board; Card; Word,,"I think A is simple and straightforward enough to get me to check out the game. E and D are a bit more artsy and might grab my attention more on certain days. A seems like the more sure bet, though."
413,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Role Playing; Strategy; Puzzle; Adventure; Action,,I like the simple and unique name combination. I feel like the others are too cheesy or over done.
414,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Arcade; Role Playing; Simulation; Strategy,,Entropy is the best title.  It signals a descent into chaos and disorder.  It makes me think that each successive wave of enemies is going to become more difficult and chaotic and when I beat them I will have accomplished something epic.
415,Male,$31-60k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Role Playing; Simulation; Strategy; Arcade; Adventure,,"E- has a unique and action packed nameC- seems to be nice and simple , which is interesting D- this has a perfect design and pattern outlook F- has a great ring to it and sounds catchyA- has a unique ring to it and raw look B- seems to be simple and classical way of representation"
416,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,Sports; Trivia; Music; Puzzle,,"These are all names that I could work with.  I did favor option E a little more.  I have always like ""Exodus"" and ""Exodus 2063"" sounds great."
417,Male,$0-30k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Arcade; Role Playing; Simulation; Sports; Puzzle,,D because the two elements are apocalypse and insect invaders. The other titles are too generic but Project Nostos actually makes you curious because you're wondering what the project involves.
418,Male,$0-30k,White,High School,35-44,Adventure; Casino; Puzzle; Role Playing; Word,,"I really like the word ""Entropy"" and I feel the near-ish future year is a perfect companion for it.  A couple of the later titles I chose are a bit too generic, but Project Nostos is nice too, though may put some people off"
419,Male,$31-60k,Asian,Graduate Degree,25-34,Adventure; Music; Role Playing,,Option E was my first choice because I thought that name fit the concept of the game and was an interesting name in its own right. Option F was my second choice because it was similar to option E but that name was slightly less memorable. Option A was my third choice because that name fit the game concept but was rather plain. Option D was my fourth choice because that name sounded interesting but didn't really fit the game concept. Option B was my fifth choice because that name was too generic to be memorable. Option C was my last choice because that name was also generic and the grammar seemed off as well.
420,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,Action; Racing; Role Playing; Simulation,,"ENTROPY 2063 sounds pretty good.  Name wise, I think it's a really good fit."
421,Male,$0-30k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Board; Card,,I prefer option A looks authentic. I find it stands out more.
422,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,Casino; Puzzle,,"I think out of all the titles, I chose option E.  I think the title Exodus 2063 is provocative enough for me to at least give the game a second look.  The other titles didn't do much for me."
423,Male,$31-60k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Action; Role Playing; Strategy; Puzzle,,I like option E because it ties into the theme of the game. I also like option D because it's vague and unique.
424,Male,$31-60k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Puzzle; Arcade,,"I think A, F, and E are pretty decent names. B and C are uninspired names for a game like this."
425,Male,$0-30k,White,High School,25-34,Arcade; Card; Educational; Strategy; Puzzle,,"I like the titles that use a realistic theme and future apocalypse setting like choice E and F for this instance, it makes it seem real"
426,Male,$0-30k,White,High School,35-44,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Role Playing; Puzzle,,"Most of the titles are a bit generic. They don't jump out at me as something that I must play. Out of the lot, only d and c are good to me. The rest could be on anything and be the same to me, they don't fit the theme."
427,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Word,,"F and C don't make a lot of sense. E and A tell us it's futuristic, as does D to a lesser extent."
428,Male,$0-30k,Hispanic,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Strategy; Role Playing; Action,,"Option E is the best. 2063 in the title lets you know immediately it's near-future. Exodus sounds cool and has that feeling of a post-apocalyptic setting. F is the next best. it has the year in the title and Entropy is another word for chaos, which fits the setting excellently. A is a little weaker, because ""Earth War"" sounds pretty bland. But it does have the year so that's a strong point. The rest are a bit weak."
429,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Casino; Adventure; Strategy,,Exodus is the only name that sounds good off the tongue. The other options sound choppy and forced.
430,Male,$61-100k,Hispanic,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Simulation; Sports; Strategy; Action; Adventure,,Sounds the coolest
431,Male,$0-30k,Black,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Role Playing; Strategy,,Earth War 2063 seems like a more appropriate title for the setting
432,Male,$31-60k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Adventure; Card; Role Playing; Simulation; Strategy,,"I like E the best because the year is set in the near future, but not too near and I like the sound of exodus."
433,Male,$0-30k,White,High School,35-44,Word; Trivia; Racing; Card; Arcade,,choice a seems the easier choice for a game title
434,Male,$31-60k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Role Playing; Strategy,,"I like option E because the name sounds the most impactful and strategic. Option F, A, and B sound very challenging too. Option C and D sound the least enticing to me!"
435,Male,$101k+,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Puzzle; Board; Card; Strategy; Trivia,,I ranked my choices based on which names I felt were the most evocative of the apocalypse.
436,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,25-34,Action; Casino; Arcade; Trivia,,"I like exodus because that is what I am trying to do in the game, send back the invading insects."
437,Male,$101k+,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Sports; Board; Puzzle,,I prefer option E because it sounds cool while also clearly letting you know that is set in the future in the year 2063
438,Male,$31-60k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Puzzle; Casino; Card; Strategy; Arcade,,"I believed my choices reflected the theme of the mobile game. Since the game is about defending your base from insects, option A ""Earth War"" reflected the theme perfectly. I also think that option F and E, also fits the mobile games narrative as the setting of the game would be in the distant future. I found the remaining choices to be the less effective at portraying the theme of the game. Especially options B and D as the names were too broad in scope. As a mobile gamer with a lot of gaming choices. It is important to have a concise name that reflects what the game is about."
439,Male,$31-60k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Role Playing; Strategy; Simulation,,"I like ""Exodus 2063"" the most because that makes me think of war that left few survivors. Everyone is doing what they can to survive. Option A is a good name too. Option F, D, and B are okay. Option C name sounds too weird."
440,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Simulation; Role Playing; Puzzle; Casino; Adventure,,"Choice A grabs my attention most, as if to talk about an actual projected war. The other options are vague in what their meaning might be."
441,Male,$61-100k,Hispanic,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Strategy; Sports; Action; Role Playing; Racing,,I think that Exodus is great name as it__ powerful in the sense that people were leaving as the world was coming to end .
442,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Racing; Strategy; Action; Adventure; Role Playing,,"F is the best because it is the most unique and interesting. I can't think of any other games with a title like this, so it will stand out more than the other titles."
443,Male,$31-60k,White,Graduate Degree,25-34,Simulation; Sports; Strategy; Puzzle; Role Playing,,"I think option A fits with the game description, is unique, memorable, and easy to understand"
444,Male,$0-30k,White,High School,25-34,Board,,"I mDe my choices based on the title that makes the game sound like a new interesting idea, even though the design makes it clear that it is similar to a dozen other games and kind of played out in general"
445,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Strategy; Word,,"E sounds like a ripoff of metro exodus, A and B don't seem that original. C and D make it seem unique and novel"
446,Male,$61-100k,Asian,Graduate Degree,25-34,Strategy; Simulation,,I based my choices on how they reflect the theme of the game
447,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,35-44,Role Playing; Music; Family; Arcade; Adventure,,Exodus elicits the most apocalyptic theme for me
448,Male,$61-100k,White,High School,45-54,Adventure; Arcade; Simulation; Trivia,,"I like the manes used in choices C & D the most...the name in choice A is somewhat basic, but I think it sounds the most relevant to the style of game it is, and I like choice D because it is somewhat ambiguous in its meaning, while still being somewhat relevant. I didn't like option E, as the word ""exodus"" means to leave or travel, which is contrary to the story of the game."
449,Male,$0-30k,Hispanic,Vocational Training,25-34,Strategy; Role Playing; Action,,This name is intriguing and unique and makes me want to learn more
450,Male,$61-100k,White,Associate Degree,35-44,Puzzle; Trivia,,I like option E because it is easy to understand.
451,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,45-54,Puzzle; Sports; Arcade; Adventure; Action,,The name returner of war sounds fierce and accurate for the game.
452,Male,$0-30k,White,High School,25-34,Action; Role Playing; Strategy,,I like the year in the title.  Very sifi
453,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,45-54,Trivia; Sports; Racing; Puzzle; Action,,The name are ranked according to how suitable they are judging by the game play. The first 3 ranked names really appeals to me.
454,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,Puzzle; Action; Adventure; Strategy; Music,,I like EarthWar best because insects are also of this Earth
455,Male,$0-30k,Other,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Role Playing; Puzzle,,I think all of the 2063 names are good with E being the best. D is fine too. C and B are too basic and boring sounding.
456,Male,$0-30k,Hispanic,High School,25-34,Role Playing; Adventure; Action,,"To start off, option D has a perfect futuristic title. Hearing that title alone tells me that this game is set in the future. Options A, F, and E are perfect for an apocalyptic game since they also give off a futuristic vibe. Option B sounds like it belongs in a set of games instead of a set alone game. Option C is flat out horrible, the name makes zero sense and tells me nothing."
457,Male,$61-100k,White,High School,35-44,Educational; Strategy; Casino; Adventure; Role Playing,,The name is easy to understand and remember. It is a fitting name for the type of game.
458,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Racing; Arcade; Board; Adventure; Action,,"The scale and size of the word exodus really makes this the best name of the options here by far. It is fitting, catchy,  memorable and matches the theme perfectly."
459,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Board; Card; Racing; Puzzle,,"Option E sounds the most dramatic and seems like it would be the most fun and engaging to play, so I would choose option E."
460,Male,$61-100k,Black,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Adventure; Racing; Strategy; Action; Simulation,,I think Option's E and D sound the best out of the six choices. If I had to choose one of the two I would go with Exodus 2063. In my opinion it has the best sound to it and really fits the description of the game better than the other titles.
461,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Music; Puzzle; Sports,,Return war sounds very interesting and appropriate for this game because the name implies that it's a battle that has come to defend.
462,Male,$0-30k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Adventure; Puzzle; Action; Strategy; Board,,"Option C is actually really unique and memorable due to how simple it is compared to the others. It's easy to say and communicate, making it stick in my mind."
463,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Arcade; Casino; Puzzle; Sports; Word,,A Is descriptive. I am told exactly what the game is and where it is occurring. D is a cool name in sounds exciting
464,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,35-44,Simulation; Puzzle; Card; Board; Adventure,,I would like to imagine it takes place in the future and having a year to think about helps me do just that.
465,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Sports; Strategy; Arcade; Adventure; Action,,i think the name in option B is the most relevant and appropriate because it implies you are defending from invaders
466,Male,$31-60k,Asian,High School,35-44,Role Playing; Simulation; Arcade,,I think showing the number year in the title is something that will get people's attention more.  It is a better descriptor of the game rather than just having a non numbered title and leaving it to people to read the description.
467,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,25-34,Strategy; Word; Puzzle; Action,,"Honestly, the one that stood out the most was Option A. You mention it's supposed to be about insect invaders, but most of these titles lead me to believe that you're playing some 'hero' returning to save the world from some existential threat. Option A was vague enough to lead me to believe it could be a war about anything."
468,Male,$61-100k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Strategy; Role Playing,,I liked choice E since the name sounds very ominous and concerning which grabs my interest. Choice D sounds too vague and specific which doesn't grab my interest.
469,Male,$101k+,Black,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Sports; Racing; Puzzle; Adventure; Action,,I would choose choice F first because the name is really nice to read and it makes it one to wanna play the game then choice E and D will be next because the names are exciting to read through and it makes one to play the game then choice B and A which are not that attractive for one to read and it does not draw much attention then last choice C will be last option because it has the least favorite tag name according to me.
470,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Trivia; Card; Casino; Sports,,I think it sounds fun. It has a sense of mystery and I'm totally interested in that
471,Male,$31-60k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Strategy; Action; Adventure; Arcade; Role Playing,,"""Exodus"" and ""Entropy"" both sound sweeping and epic, which is appealing. Very cool for sure!"
472,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Adventure; Board; Card; Casino,,"Since the game is about defending territories, then Defender Series seems most appropriate."
473,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Trivia; Puzzle; Educational; Board; Action,,I like the ones with a year more in it although although the other ones aren't bad either. The last one I'm not a fan of though I just feel it sounds kind of goofy
474,Male,$31-60k,White,Graduate Degree,25-34,Adventure; Puzzle; Arcade,,I like how the names help give a sense of where the action is taking place and what's going on. The more descriptive the name is the better it feels and more interactive it would be for the game. It immediately gets you interested and involved.
475,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Adventure; Strategy; Role Playing,,Defender series sounds the worst by far.  The others could all be possibilities depending on the plot and setting.
476,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Adventure; Arcade; Puzzle; Role Playing; Strategy,,I think the options with '2063' are best because they help drive home the near future aspect which could get lost in a generic post-apocalyptic setting.
477,Male,$0-30k,White,High School,25-34,Action; Adventure; Puzzle; Word; Music,,"A, the name sounds very interesting and fits well, it makes me think it's about fighting and it's set in the near future.F, the name sounds interesting, and makes me want to try the game, it also makes me think it's set in the near future.D, I find the name project makes me think of an experiment, or test, and it makes me slightly less interested.E, the name sounds very interesting, it makes me curious what's the ""exodus"" and that it's set in the near future.C, I find the word ""returner"" makes me much less interesting, it's unappealing and sounds odd.B, I I dislike the word series, it makes the game sound like it's some sort of football game, it makes me much less interesting."
478,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Puzzle; Sports; Strategy,,I like B because it relates back to defending my territory from the insect invaders and it also implies that there will be multiple attacks (a series) that I will have to battle through.
479,Male,$101k+,White,Associate Degree,35-44,Sports; Casino; Simulation; Arcade; Action,,I picked E first because I think they have the year close and Exodus is a perfect explanation. Choice B is too generic.
480,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,Card; Board; Racing; Puzzle; Adventure,,The webpage theme was really looking awesome. The name that mentioned in the option B was too good and it was perfectly matching to that theme which was in the option B.
481,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Role Playing; Strategy,,"I prefer the option A game name because earth war 2063 sounds the most exciting and shows that the entire world is at war in this game. I chose options E and F second and third because both of these game names highlight the impact of the year 2063 and exodus sounds more interesting than entropy. I chose options D and C fourth and fifth because the project game name sounds like this is a special operations style game, which sounds more interesting than the returner war in the option C game name. I chose option B last because the defenders series sounds the most bland and boring game name and is not easy to remember at all."
482,Male,$0-30k,White,Associate Degree,35-44,Action; Puzzle; Strategy,,"Not going to lie, wasn__ a fan of any of them. I think defender series is the best because you have to survive against waves of enemy__ but it doesn__ tell you much about story. I think the other names could be interesting if I learn a little more but based on what I have, this is my pick."
483,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,45-54,Puzzle,,"I prefer B, as ""Defender"" series speaks to the defense of the Earth from the invaders.  I also think A and D are good choices, as ""Earth War"" conveys the idea well.  I dislike using the word entropy and like choice F the least.  Are we really falling into disorder and chaos?"
484,Male,$101k+,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Word; Strategy; Role Playing; Adventure; Action,,I like Exodus 2063 the best. Exodus just gives me a feeling of the future and something terrible has happened. My next favorite is Project Nostros. I think Project Nostos gives off a vibe of intrigue. Earth War and Returner War both are similar to me. They definitely give off a futuristic war that we have to defend against. Entropy and Defender series seems so generic that it doesn't really pique my interest.
485,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Adventure; Casino; Music; Sports,,Option A is the best choice for a name for this game because it involves protecting territory on the planet earth and some of the other names don't relate to the game concept nearly as well.
486,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Adventure,,Exodus is a really cool name. I also like the ones that refer to war.
487,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Strategy; Sports; Racing,,i like the idea of putting the year on the title to show that is not far away
488,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Action; Adventure; Strategy; Trivia; Word,,"I like earth war 2023. I feel like that title is really simple and self explanatory. It totally fits what you describe. Some of the others like entropy, Nostos, and returners, have no meaning to me."
489,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Adventure; Arcade; Casino; Sports; Trivia,,Options F and E are the strongest titles of this assortment; they make the game sound interesting and intriguing. I would be most inclined to choose these two. The remaining options are much less appealing to me; none of them sound exciting or powerful.
490,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,25-34,Word; Strategy; Trivia,,"I thought F sounded cool and unique, it really captured the intended theme of the game in an appealing way. I also thought D was pretty good, but the others weren__ as appealing."
491,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,25-34,Casino,,most unique and customizable
492,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Casino; Puzzle; Action; Adventure; Sports,,I think entropy and exodus have a bug sound to the name which I like.
493,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Board; Simulation; Strategy; Puzzle; Role Playing,,"Having the word War in the title makes me know right away what type of game it is going to be, so I like C and A the most"
494,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,Strategy; Simulation; Role Playing,,"I like the title ""Earth War 2063"" the most because it tells me the most about the game. I understand that it will be a sci-fi game set in the near future, there's a war, and it's probably some type of strategy game."
495,Male,$0-30k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Role Playing; Strategy,,Option E creates a sense for the need to escape and start anew.
496,Male,$101k+,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Sports; Card; Trivia; Word; Puzzle,,"Earth War seems like the most sellable. The other words, Entropy, Exodus, Nostos, don't seem to be relatable or have the right comprehension for the audience. Returner War is cool. It creates this vision of military returning to fight the war. there is a cool factor to that idea."
497,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Strategy; Role Playing; Simulation; Action; Adventure,,"Exodus is a more catchy word than the rest.  DUe to this, this is my top pick"
498,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Adventure; Puzzle; Racing; Role Playing; Simulation,,"Earth War just sounds more dire and apocalyptic.  Exodus and Entropy are okay, but options B, C, and D sound really generic.  I like the graphic too - it makes me think of a war, so that's why I chose Earth War."
499,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Strategy; Puzzle; Adventure,,"I like option A because I think the title will resonate with more people. I think when you have the whole planet vs something, that makes it a really big deal."
500,Male,$0-30k,White,High School,25-34,,,I picked B and C as my top choices as the outfits look like they are very cool and comfy to wear.
501,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,35-44,,,My top pick is best because he looks like a typical gangster/bouncer.
502,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,,,"I voted for option A, he reminds me of the bouncer I've met working at one of the nightclubs downtown here where i live, so already this is believable for me."
503,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,I think that option B best fits the style of a bouncer.  His outfit is the most intimidating and would fit the role as a bouncer
504,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,45-54,,,"The logo vest, microphone, and ear piece look more intimidating. The leather jacket is ok too. The short sleeve shirt and chain do not look as intimidating."
505,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,35-44,,,"I like the look of C as it is not typical of what you would expect and makes him come off as having more class or education then a typical gangster . B and C are about equal, they are not bad just what I would expect nd kind of typical"
506,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,,,"Option B looks less like a guard and more like a dealer. Option A looks more like a pimp and less like a bouncer. Option C is the best one, I could imagine him standing at the door of a strip club."
507,Male,$0-30k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,I like the style in option C the best. I like his clothing choice of a light blue collar shirt with a black vest. I also like how he has tattoos on both arms.
508,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,25-34,,,looks toughest and scariest with the tats and the muscles showing
509,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,B or C have the most bouncer-ish appeal to me. They both look upscale and like someone I would expect as a bouncer to a club. I think the big difference is the type of strip club they are bouncing for.
510,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,"Choice C is the one that I like the best because the look on his face combined with the arms crossed pose shows to me that he is serious and knows that he is someone who is intimidating. That he only needs to do this look and pose and it will ward off the vast majority of unruly people from causing trouble. I like how his look is more like a work outfit for the bar. Also, how he seems the most muscular of the three. Choice A is second because he has the more classic bouncer pose with how he is standing and has his arms down. I like the look on his face that says, ""so you think you can get by me."" The outfit is also one that is really fitting to me as well. Choice B is last because while he looks intimidating I was not really feeling the pose he was in at all compared to the other two choices. I also did not like the outfit as much as it looks baggy to me."
511,Male,$0-30k,Black,High School,25-34,,,dress was very fit and neat
512,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,"I think the image shown in C is the best, it gives off the most professional appearance and also seems very tough. I like that he has a radio and a nicer uniform. That is how I would expect a strip club bouncer to look. A is a bit too casual and B just doesn't seem intimidating."
513,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,,,"The vest gives him more of a professional look, like he actually works at the establishment. The vest helps to assert his authority without him having to say anything."
514,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,The outfit and the stance of my top choice make the most sense for him
515,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,,,"I feel C is the most fitting. He is sharply dressed, but not too sharp. Also, the tattoos are a nice touch and convey he is a force to be reckoned with."
516,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,"The bouncer in Image C is dressed very appropriately , his outfit is great for this job, and i like that he has some tattoos, makes him look authoritative and  fearful."
517,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,45-54,,,"I love the style in option C with the outfit but the face looks too cool and flirty. The style in option C on the other hand, looks ready for decisive actions."
518,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,i think the character in option C looks the best because the description makes him look to have a relevant moral character
519,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,"I was drawn toward B for the different color scheme. He's got the earpiece and the vest over the blue shirt that makes him look unique and in uniform. You would be able to easily pick him out of a crowd in a game. This also shows off his tattoos, which seem like an important part of his toughness. He's very intimidating. You could believe he's a bouncer who tackles other gang members. Perhaps the other characters look more like rappers or people who would otherwise be in the club."
520,Male,$0-30k,Hispanic,Less than High School Diploma,25-34,,,"A is best because when you think of a bouncer this is what i would imagine them wearing, B is next because when i think of a gangster this is what i see them wearing more than the others, and C looks to professional and the clothes look too tight to be effective."
521,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,"We have a gang-themed mobile game, here are 3 styles of a gangster who works as a bouncer in a strip club. Based on his description, which one fits the best? Which style do you prefer and why? What elements attract you the most?- I like Image C with the gangster with the vest and dress shirt - he looks the most upgraded of the gangsters here, like he means business and has seen some action!"
522,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,"The tattoos and two-colored outfit sticks out and fits the job type in my opinion.  He also looks the strongest and scariest, which fits as well."
523,Male,$61-100k,Asian,Graduate Degree,25-34,,,"I like Option C the most since he looks fit and like a tough guy, which is the most fitting look for a man in his profession. Option B is the least appealing because he looks too chunky to fit the job."
524,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,,,I thought my first choice looked the most real and authentic and looked like they were the most intimidating.
525,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,,,"What I liked about Option A is that I immediately thought of a stereotypical bouncer.  He looked tough and no-nonsense, but he also looked professional and someone nobody would want to mess with.  Option C looked more like security detail, but plenty tough and would be my second option.  As for Option B, I think he didn't look tough enough.  I imagine the smile was intended to perhaps show his trustworthiness, but I felt it took away from the edge I would think this character would have."
526,Male,$0-30k,White,High School,45-54,,,A is dressed appropriately and has a mean demeanor. B has the right look except he's smiling which seems inappropriate for a bouncer. C appears to be wearing a uniform that you would wear when working at a grocery store.
527,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,Option C is my choice for the bouncer because he definitely looks the type with the bearing and attitude and dress and the tattoos all working together.
528,Male,$0-30k,Hispanic,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,A I feel has the best design to it that is able match well with the description of the character.
529,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,"C looks the most dangerous.  He is strong, powerful, and the tattos on his arm make hime look like a bad ass."
530,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,25-34,,,"I like the visible tattoos in option C and I like the vest, it gives him a trustworthy quality or a sweetheart quality which would leave me to believe that the strippers like him."
531,Male,$31-60k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,,,"I like the use of the vest in my top choice, which is fun and unique. Very cool design for sure!"
532,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,I thinn that the not smiling and showing of the arms and the muscles makes him look more intimidating
533,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,,,A gangster is unlikely to wear a uniform.  He is more likely to wear all black and have a leather coat so he can hide his gun
534,Male,$31-60k,Hispanic,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,I think the leather jacket has the sleekest look and design for it.
535,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,I PREFER A BECAUSE HE FITS THE MOST
536,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,It looks like a normal guy. I think he'd be the funnest to play with.
537,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,Option C looks like he takes no shit and would fit in with the theme best.
538,Male,$101k+,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,,,"As a bouncer he needs to be intimidating and C gives me that vibe more than the other ones. B is a close second with his look. C looks a little more overweight in the baggy clothing, which makes him less menacing."
539,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,25-34,,,I thought the overall look of C best fit the bouncer theme and seemed the most real. I liked the outfit choice.  Next I liked the shorter sleeves in B more so than the jacket in A.
540,Male,$61-100k,Hispanic,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,For me it is the black leather jacket look. That fits what I have seen a lot for bouncers or security type guys like this.
541,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,,,"This style looks cool and modern, I like his pose, exudes power and looks aggressive. Option A looks fine, I like the outfit, but looks less intimidating than my first choice. Option B doesn't appeal to me at all, his style is a bit dated and his pose seems very friendly."
542,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,"C has a cocky sort of pose, a and b seem to be a lot stronger and less haughty"
543,Male,$31-60k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,,,The tattoos have some intimidation factor to them as well.
544,Male,$0-30k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,"I choose A, Because his body figure and his attire really is the best and more to be fitting for a bouncer on a game and it look cooler also."
545,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,My choices A why because i really like it..
546,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,"Option C seems most likely to work in this profession. The vest is the component. Option B, with the chain, is also a close second."
547,Male,$0-30k,White,Graduate Degree,25-34,,,Option C looks like a mall cop. I like the A most since it is simple enough and tells us how rough the guy is. In option B I did not like the necklace
548,Male,$0-30k,White,High School,35-44,,,Option B just look closest to what I normally picture when if I think about a bouncer.
549,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,,,"Just based on character design, I like option C.  It's a cool looking character design.   I think C is a great looking character design.  Very cool."
550,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Racing; Arcade; Board; Adventure; Action,,"This character is a fantastic representation of a game such as this because it clearly shows that a once normal, and helpful, good person has been taken over by evil and something that needs to be fought against in a very relatable manner."
551,Male,$0-30k,Hispanic,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Sports; Adventure; Action,,"I feel that E is a design that stands out the most to me, and is the most well done. It is able to draw my interest to it the most, and very unique compared to the rest."
552,Male,$0-30k,Other,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Role Playing; Puzzle,,C and H are the true zombie looking characters. A lot of the rest of these are from video games already. G is The Last of Us. E is Resident Evil 8. F is Gears of War. And A is Prototype. Not sure the reason for this. But these also don't look like zombies anyways other than maybe G.
553,Male,$0-30k,Hispanic,Vocational Training,25-34,Strategy; Role Playing; Action,,"H is a very cool unique design. It looks strong and bulky, yet fast too. Option D is very interesting as well, being a scorpion/zombie hybrid."
554,Male,$61-100k,Hispanic,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Simulation; Sports; Strategy; Action; Adventure,,H looks the coolest and most unique
555,Male,$101k+,Black,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Sports; Racing; Puzzle; Adventure; Action,,"I would choose choice C first because it has a face of a person and the the fact there is blood on the mouth and the face it shows that it is a zombie and it looks like it has come from war then choice G and E will be next because I find them closer to the face of a zombie and also the fact that they are holding weapons means they are from or going into a war so it will be easy to know that they are war characters then choice B and H, I will choose B because it has the body structure of a person although the face is not that visible to know if it has blood on it from the war then choice H which has several faces with blood on it and it seems like it has left war so it will be a good image then the next choices will be D and A which really do not resemble a zombie because they have half a human body and the other half is the body of an animal then the last option will be F which is not really a zombie because it just a hand that is scary alone with no body or face to it so I will have it as the least favorite images of all."
556,Male,$61-100k,Black,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Adventure; Racing; Strategy; Action; Simulation,,"I think Option H has the most visual impact out of the eight choices. I like Option H the most because the creature is the most believable and practical for a post-apocalyptic zombie themed game. The zombies wouldn't be so fresh looking like in Option C, and they certainly wouldn't be mutations or cybernetic creations. I think becoming a giant bio mass like in Option H is much more interesting, realistic and fun!"
557,Male,$61-100k,White,Associate Degree,35-44,Puzzle; Trivia,,I like option C because it has the most detail in the character and it is more believable.
558,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,Action; Racing; Role Playing; Simulation,,Option H is quite a character.  There's a lot of visual impact there.  That's a character design that really stands out well.  Very interesting character design.
559,Male,$61-100k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Strategy; Role Playing,,I liked choice A since ethe character looks the most intimidating and strong while also realistic. Choice E looks too fake with the saw hands which isn't realistic.
560,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Role Playing; Strategy,,"I prefer the option C zombie character design because I like the outfit and the interesting facial expressions of this zombie the most. I chose options H and D second and third because I like these large, disfigured zombie creatures with the multiple heads, arms and claws because they look very scary. I chose options E and B fourth and fifth because I like these more traditional humanoid zombie creatures who look like tough soldiers wearing masks and having weapons for arms. I chose options G and F sixth and seventh because I do not like the terribly mutilated female zombie character design nor the spider-like or insect-like zombie very much. I chose option A last because this zombie character design looks very unimpressive and just looks like some teenage, long-haired boy with a tail whip and deformed arm, which is not appealing."
561,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Arcade; Strategy; Trivia; Role Playing; Simulation,,"Option H has the most visual impact because of the fact that it has three different heads there, which is eye-catching and makes it stand out in comparison to the other 7 options. Option G is ranked last because the pose is non-threatening and the character itself doesn't seem imposing."
562,Male,$0-30k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Role Playing; Strategy,,Option E of robotic parts creates a sense of futuristic theme being applied as well.
563,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Sports; Strategy; Arcade; Adventure; Action,,the design in option D has the most visual impact because of the scorpion and human design
564,Male,$0-30k,White,High School,35-44,Word; Trivia; Racing; Card; Arcade,,"choices h,c,d have the highest range of visual impact among the characters i found"
565,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Arcade; Casino; Puzzle; Sports; Word,,"B,D and A Are all very cool. All three of these creatures look powerful, strong, and scary."
566,Male,$0-30k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Adventure; Puzzle; Action; Strategy; Board,,The options that look more realistic while still being grounded and interesting looking help immerse me more in the game.
567,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Arcade; Simulation; Strategy,,Option C is the most realistic Zombie design. I don't think zombies looking like non human monsters are very realistic for a post apocalyptic zombie strategy game. I like the zombified cop look. It is very creepy
568,Male,$0-30k,White,High School,25-34,Action,,I like option e because it is something that seems like a classic design but has its own twist on it which makes it unique.
569,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Adventure; Board; Card; Casino,,Option C seems most dramatic to me because it looks so real and seems more like that it exists.   The other ones that look like monsters seem more ideal then zombies that look like dead cyborgs.
570,Male,$31-60k,White,Graduate Degree,25-34,Adventure; Puzzle; Arcade,,I think generally the larger more action oriented characters have more of a visual impact just because they're bigger and quicker to identify with. They make you think about what's going on and how things could change around.
571,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Trivia; Card; Casino; Sports,,I've never seen a character like that he's like a spider/scorpion man it's very interesting
572,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Adventure; Casino; Music; Sports,,Options B and A are my top choices because they have the most visual appeal for such a game as a result of overall design and costume and their demeanor.
573,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,Family; Puzzle; Action; Role Playing; Strategy,,"A really does not fit with any of these. There is generally an accepted set of rules with the genre, Zombies are mutated people by chemicals or by extra terrestrial forces but many of these mutations, Like Option A, do not make sense. Option G fits the genre but is just kind of lame. Option B looks more like a Psycho and less like a zombie. Option F kind of works but it is hard to imagine how it moves. Option C is simplistic but plausible. Option H is nice and scary.  It is hard to imagine how a zombie gets melded with technology but it would make for a great story as seen in Option E. Option D is my favorite, I could see how the mutation could happen and it terrifies me.."
574,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Trivia; Puzzle; Educational; Board; Action,,"i like all of these but some are a bit harder to see due to dark coloring. numbers 1, 2, 3 and 4 are all really awesome and i like have the largest inpact because they are rather novel creatures with distinctily human traits still while adding others - arms, stingers, etc. 5 is awesome, but a bit overdone. 5 is awesome because it's right up in your face and rather scary. 3 is a bit dark though and looks like a hand with an extra finger. 6 is hard to see but you can tell there is something very different about the face - either that or she is bowing her head and looking down and has blonde hair. 7 and 8 aren't bad, 7 is an intersting glow and a cool pose, whilte 8 is a bit intersting - does have have a machine gun for arms or a rotating saw?"
575,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Strategy; Role Playing; Simulation; Action; Adventure,,"This creature looks the most menacing.  Due to him looking terribly intimidating, this is my top pick"
576,Male,$0-30k,White,High School,25-34,Action; Adventure; Puzzle; Word; Music,,"B, it looks very humanoid and makes me imagine what the person might have been before.G, the creature looks very humanoid while having the appearance of a zombie, it makes me think about what the character was before.E, I find the creature looks very interesting, however it also doesn't really interest me as much due to the tools and attachments.C, The close up makes me really interested in the characters as you can see they look like a police captain.A, The character looks kind of interesting, however I dislike the super power that the character appears to have.H, I find the creature looks very different from a human, it looks like several connected together, it makes me much less interested.D, The creature doesn't make me think zombie, but instead an odd science experiment gone wrong.F, I find the creature doesn't make me think it's a zombie at all as it has no relation to a human appearance."
577,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Racing; Role Playing; Sports; Trivia,,These are all great images for different types of zombies
578,Male,$101k+,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Casino; Trivia; Strategy; Sports; Puzzle,,Hands down C.  It is realistic and it does not add any elements that seem even more unlikely. This truly looks like a zombie created from a guard.  All of the other items either seem too cartoonish or unrealistic (I realize how that sounds). Like why is a crab morphed into a human? Or how did the zombie attach a drill to its arm.  B is ok. The drawing seems a bit cartoonish though. All of the rest seem like a fantasy drawing or sketch
579,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Adventure; Puzzle; Role Playing; Strategy,,I chose option C as my favorite zombie design because it is the most realistic.  I like that it looks like it is a real person and that they were a cop and before the became a zombie which makes it seem more real if I was playing it.
580,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Adventure; Strategy; Role Playing,,"I'd say C, mostly because it's a close up with more detail.  D and F are fairly unique and interesting.  The others not so much,"
581,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Puzzle,,"The ones with the most visual impact are those which combine human and non-human features; those are much more terrifying that just the zombified human images. In particular, I found H  most impactful as it has multiple heads, then D since it has multiple legs and a scorpion tail, then F with the spider features. There's a dropoff here; the others all have less impact to me."
582,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Sports; Adventure; Role Playing; Action; Arcade,,"A was by far the best out of the bunch, the last four were awful pictures to get people to play"
583,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Action; Adventure; Strategy; Trivia; Word,,"H has the most visual impact to me. It__ the scariest. The three torsos and whip arms make it look unpredictable. I would be most intimidated to battle that one. Most of the rest just look like zombie people, which seems less original. F looks dumb"
584,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,Casino; Puzzle,,"I chose option A, it reminds me of a comic book I used to collect.  I really like the blade fingers and the scorpion whip like arm.  It's very fantastical and makes me think that the game is going to be action oriented."
585,Male,$0-30k,White,High School,35-44,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Role Playing; Puzzle,,"Some of the designs are very impactful, but nowhere near theme for the game. The idea of zombies is that it can be any one of us as the monster. So, seeing a cop, also an authority figure, as one hits home that something is wrong. Beyond C, G is the only one that feels it is slightly on theme, but the idea of a zombie is biting and tearing apart. How can a mushroom bite me? The rest are impactful, but completely off theme so rated down for it. Glow boy, B could be a zombie but feels more like something else. So B is third."
586,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,Action; Board; Sports; Strategy; Simulation,,My primary selection was chosen because of the details of the image.  It is by far the most realistic of all of the images presented.  It almost looks more like a photograph than a drawing.
587,Male,$31-60k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Puzzle; Strategy; Action; Simulation; Card,,"It can stand alone, as a background, or be applied to other elements, like lines, shapes, textures or typography."
588,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Music; Puzzle; Sports,,"The image in Option C shows a good visual depicting an actual zombie in a later stage of transition, it looks very realistic and well designed."
589,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Casino; Puzzle; Action; Adventure; Sports,,I like the traditional zombie looks or the options with a lot of complex graphics.
590,Male,$61-100k,Asian,Graduate Degree,25-34,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Racing; Sports,,I ranked the designs of the monsters for a zombie apocalyptic game that I liked the most.  I found the monster in option H to be the most scary looking.  I then liked the way option D looked followed by option C followed by option E followed by option F then option B.  I then liked the design of the monster of option A more than option G.
591,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Puzzle; Sports; Strategy,,I think the most-human like designs have the most impact because they are the most relatable.  Seeing someone like me be zombie-fied is more terrifying than seeing a non-human like creature because I'm less worried about turning into something that looks nothing like me.
592,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,Strategy; Simulation; Role Playing,,The mutant zombie is by far the scariest and most intimidating. It looks like a cross between a demon and the undead. This image is the stuff of nightmares. I would find this enemy to be very intimidating in game.
593,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Role Playing; Simulation,,"c is the only to me that looks like a ""normal"" zombie, which is what I personally prefer. While H, G, E, and B all look like mutant parasite zombies characters from the famous Resident Evil series. Bonus: D isn't really a zombie, but it does look amazing."
594,Male,$31-60k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Role Playing; Simulation; Strategy; Arcade; Adventure,,F- this seems to be realistic ad great outlook C- this seems to be having a good design and outlook H- this has intense look and design is flawlessA- it has unique structure and outlook which is appealing B- this has a great details which is very rigid and legit E- seems to be very much realistic and visually appealing D- has a great design and outlook to it G- seems to be simple and clean outlook
595,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Casino; Puzzle; Trivia,,I think the monsters in both D and H look the scariest and make the most impact. The scorpion looking guy in D looks very tough and like it would be hard to fight. I feel H is very gory and dangerous as well. I don't know what is going on in G and C looks like a generic zombie though it is very detailed. F is hard to figure out exactly what it is but it looks different and unique. I like the character in A the most and E for his saw arm but neither seem to make as much impact as the two in D and H.
596,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,25-34,Action; Casino; Arcade; Trivia,,"The combination between a scorpion and a zombie is terrifying in option D, It is an image that will follow me into my nightmares. I also like the touch of blue, this makes it very eye catching."
597,Male,$0-30k,White,High School,35-44,Strategy; Action,,"The first 3 really grab you pretty quick. So much detail, movement, overall uniqueness."
598,Male,$61-100k,Hispanic,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Strategy; Sports; Action; Role Playing; Racing,,"I am not sure what kind of monster or creature this is, but it is definitely something that will be etched in your mind for a while. This thing is very demonic and scary looking. Which is perfect for a game of this nature."
599,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Action; Adventure; Educational; Racing; Simulation,,"They are all pretty effective, however C is far and away the most scary and detailed"
600,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Casino; Trivia; Word; Action; Arcade,,"C, A and E were all tops because of the characters were recognizable to a sense.  C was completely recognizable and clear."
601,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,25-34,Word; Strategy; Trivia,,"I thought C was most impactful due to the real ness of the face and the detailed bloody look of the torso. I also thought B was good because it captured the strain and look of being infected. The others I didn__ care for as much, particularly the ones that looked like large creatures."
602,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Casino; Puzzle; Simulation; Word,,My first choice has the most visual impact to me. It looks the most threatening and intimidating in my opinion.
603,Male,$31-60k,White,Associate Degree,25-34,Adventure; Arcade,,"I think option C has the most detail, it looks the most lifelike and realistic looking almost like a real person would"
604,Male,$0-30k,Black,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Role Playing; Strategy,,"The images in Options D, H, and C are enough to give you nightmares for weeks"
605,Male,$101k+,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Arcade; Puzzle; Action,,This was a difficult choice as they were all different. I choose D as the crab man looked the most intimidating. The rest were all good as well. The order was personal preference on my part according to my subjective scariness factor.
606,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Adventure; Arcade; Puzzle; Role Playing; Strategy,,I think the non humanoid options are the most visually striking and cause the most visceral reaction. The humanoids suffer from the overuse of zombie trope in my opinion.
607,Male,$101k+,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Arcade; Action; Adventure,,"Some of these choices are very unrealistic. Even in a zombie apocalypse, people will not immediately change how they look. Therefore I picked the most realistic looking pictures."
608,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Board; Simulation; Strategy; Puzzle; Role Playing,,D and A are really cool and unique designs. I have not really seen monsters that look that way before so I was drawn in to their new and unique look
609,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,35-44,Casino; Adventure; Arcade; Action; Role Playing,,"My top pick looks the most detailed, plus it makes the most sense for a zombie game, the rest just look like mutations or like something from anime."
610,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Casino; Adventure; Strategy,,The sense if realism I got from my top choice is truly creepy and is easily the most memorable of all the options
611,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,Educational; Puzzle; Simulation; Trivia,,"When I think zombies, I think the more humanoid, the more likely they are a real zombie.  When I see zombies that are non humanoid (have more than 2 legs, don't walk upright, have more than 1 head, have strange appendages), I think more about aliens and less about human zombies."
612,Male,$101k+,White,Graduate Degree,25-34,Puzzle; Role Playing; Adventure,,"D and H seem interesting, but most of these are just copied and ripped off of other games"
613,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Strategy; Simulation,,"I think H is by far the most impactful of all the images. It is truly terrifying, the multi head, the red appearance and the tentacles are quite scary and really impact me. The others are all varying degrees of impact but H really stands out."
614,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,35-44,Adventure; Simulation; Strategy; Trivia; Role Playing,,"i think the clawlike spider hand has the most visual impact, it invoked a reaction from me first"
615,Male,$61-100k,Black,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Adventure; Action; Role Playing; Strategy; Simulation,,I like option C the best because the close up view of the zombified police officer is really creepy due to the way the character looks and grabs my attention the most out of all the options.
616,Male,$0-30k,White,High School,25-34,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Music; Puzzle,,"I picked B, A and G as my top choices as the designs look like they belong in the game and they can give out aa big punch. I picked C as my least favorite as it looks too generic."
617,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Action; Puzzle; Trivia; Strategy,,The ones that are more unhuman jump out more and just catch my attention more
618,Male,$0-30k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Action; Adventure; Role Playing; Strategy; Educational,,"The design in option D creates the most impact . It looks like a half zombie, half scorpion creature which is scary and interesting. I like the blue glow on its claws and legs."
619,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Role Playing; Strategy; Puzzle; Adventure; Action,,I don't like the tech zombies theme as much as the natural and animal zombies.
620,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Trivia; Strategy,,"I think that option D has the best and most unique design.  I can imagine what it would be like to play against this character.  I can imagine how it would move and attack, as well as the type of fighter it is."
621,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Adventure; Puzzle; Card; Action; Strategy,,H is most impactful because it is creepy looking without looking silly like the scorpion guy there.  A looks like a cool idea for a protagonist though.
622,Male,$61-100k,Asian,Graduate Degree,25-34,Word; Trivia; Puzzle; Arcade; Action,,"For a zombie-themed game, I generally prefer zombies that look like they were very recently regular people. For that reason, Options C and G are the most appealing. After that, you start getting into some rather fantastical designs that look more like the result of targeted experimentation rather than organic mutations from a zombie virus. I suppose you could use some of the other ones as ""Boss"" monsters to mix in with the regular infected."
623,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Action; Arcade; Word,,The most impactful and vile ones were the ones that looked like they could have been human at some point but mutated and evolved and became this way. I also just liked the art style of my top choices.
624,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,Sports; Strategy; Racing,,"I like E because it reminds me of the Patriarch boss from Killing Floor a little bit. Besides that, the character looks like a tough zombie that is out for blood."
625,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,Music; Strategy; Word,,I picked the creature in H. I love the deep crimson/red color and how mysterious it looks. The tentacles feel menacing as well.
626,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Adventure; Action,,Only C strikes me as being a zombie. The rest all seem to be different creatures
627,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Adventure; Arcade; Casino; Sports; Trivia,,"Option D is clearly the most original and outstanding among these choices. It's bold, exciting, and appealing. Options H and F are likewise unique, and these appeal to me as well. Option C is the last 'strong' option, in my opinion; options G, E, A, and B all seem somewhat conventional and not especially original. None of these last four appeals to me in the same manner."
628,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Card; Casino; Puzzle; Strategy,,I picked in the order I would like to fight in a game.  D and H I would more see as later more powerful zombies and B would be more of a typical zombie in the game.
629,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,35-44,Board; Card; Word,,"I definitely like these more ""out there"" designs, way more memorable than a standard zombie style and the body horror aspect adds to the effect."
630,Male,$61-100k,Other,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Adventure,,C has the most impact to me personally because it strikes the most emotion within me. This image almost makes me fearful and able to visualize what may have happened to other people from this enemy.
631,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,35-44,Action; Adventure; Role Playing; Simulation; Strategy,,"D, A, F , and H are great. they look creepy and unsettling and unique. I like D the most by far it is very unsettling . C is pretty standard zombie to me and its not bad but kind of boring and expected but does look nice.  G looks more like a silent hill type character E and B I do not like they come off as somethign else besides zombies and B makes me think of Bane but worse"
632,Male,$101k+,White,High School,35-44,Simulation; Strategy; Puzzle,,"C in particular is recognizably a person with a career and personality before being infected.  H looks like an amalgamation of a few people, so it's creepy.  B, E, and G also show a human who has clearly been taken over, so there's a sense of loss and also an uneasy feeling of whatever happened to them happening to me.  The rest just look like standard monster things that are a little creepy, but don't also give me a feeling of dread or loss."
633,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Strategy; Puzzle; Adventure,,Option C is the most impactful as it looks the most realistic by far. I think that makes it really hit home and make it creepy.
634,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Word; Sports; Action,,"Option C matches a bit of realism with some surreal zombie elements. It strikes me as a stereotypical zombie when I would imagine one, as well as the army uniform, so it gets to the point of the game. Yet, it has some uniqueness and edge to it that seem original enough to stand out."
635,Male,$31-60k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Strategy; Action; Adventure; Arcade; Role Playing,,"My top choice is most striking and intimidating, which is appealing for sure. It looks like something out of a Resident Evil game!"
636,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Action; Adventure; Role Playing; Puzzle; Strategy,,"I know ""realistic"" doesn't fit with zombies, but i chose the more realism-based models, ones that seem close enough to human to make you feel fear, not some supernatural beings. F D and A fit that description, and C was just totally different that the rest. I like H B and G the best, they seem the most rooted in some form of ""realistic"" zombie models."
637,Male,$31-60k,White,Graduate Degree,25-34,Puzzle; Strategy,,I like the more mutated looking zombies. The ones that are merged or half insect seem the coolest.
638,Male,$61-100k,Black,High School,35-44,Casino; Sports; Strategy,,"Option H has the most impact in my opinion because seeing the zombie with three heads, multiple arms and talons would be terrifying. It is the most unique and reminds me of something out of a horror movie."
639,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Strategy; Word,,B and g we're pretty boring to me. I think option c is the best by far because it shows the character in so much detail
640,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Card; Trivia; Strategy,,"The first choice, H, is both realistic and disturbing. It would be very memorable and I would fear this creature in the game. It would cause a visceral reaction. Option E is less wild than H but very realistic like it could happen in real life. The lower ranked options seemed to outlandish and cartoonish."
641,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Word,,"I prefer a more human-like character in these types of games.  I don't need some one-off creepy character, give me something that at least looked like a human at some point."
642,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,Role Playing; Sports; Action,,"Absolutely C.  It is by far the most realistic and frightening, as any zombie style game or movie should be.  The rest are almost cartoonish"
643,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Simulation; Action; Puzzle; Racing; Strategy,,"the top few look the most scary, creepy, unique and attention grabbing, the lower ranked choices are more generic or cartoonish"
644,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Adventure; Strategy; Role Playing; Simulation,,"I love B and E they look cool are not to overwhelming but impact me and grab my attention. C is great but to creepy. A,D,F,H and G are just to weird for me."
645,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,45-54,Puzzle; Music; Action,,"I chose the ones I did in that sequence based on exactly that - impact.  I preferred the ones with the gray and brown tones because they looked more unique and authentic.  I also preferred bolder designs with a preference for characters that stood out.  They mostly did so based on their body language, pose, and design in general.  I guess I like the Mad Max aesthetic and my favorite one (D with the most visual impact) also was a different take on the concept.  I really liked B and E as well because they had that same look and feel and were bold.  H looked like it belonged to a different game and A was too cartoonish...which is why I chose them last."
646,Male,$101k+,White,Associate Degree,35-44,Sports; Casino; Simulation; Arcade; Action,,"I chose C first because the zombie looks military and I think in the end days to come, war will be involved. I picked D last because it looks the least realistic."
647,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Action,,"It has to be H. It's like a Lovecraftian or Doom hellbeast. It's the most visually stunning and the red coloring attracts your eye. You can tell it's a mutated human and it LOOKS very threatening. Perhaps it is more hellish than zombie-ish. However, it is the one that is most impactful for those reasons. I prefer designs that aren't generic humanoid zombies, since a million different games have done that and they tend to all look the same. That is why A, F, and D end up being after that as well. They have more intrigue behind them and look more threatening and also interesting than generic shamblers."
648,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Strategy; Sports; Racing; Adventure; Action,,"I think that Option H has the most visual impact because I believe that it is the most unique, interesting, and terrifying zombie character design out of the eight options. There are quite a few post-apocalyptic survival/zombie-themed games out there, so I think that it is important to have unique character designs that separate your game from the rest of the pack."
649,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Action; Adventure; Role Playing; Simulation; Strategy,,"For me, I tend to be a big fan of humanlike monsters and zombies because I could relate to them and picture myself turning into them. C in particular is very gory and striking. B's zombie looks really scary and in agony, and that has an impact on me. G's face is downright scary! The rest are really good but range in order from really interesting and outlandish to ""I've seen that before""."
650,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,"I'd love to explore D the most because it looks like a volcanic almost ruined atmosphere. It makes me curious what other dark things lie in wait.  I also like A a lot with the cloud city, it really gets my imagination going with the light colored swirls.  G's lightning captivates me too.  The purple fantasy landscape with storm brewing calls me to action.  B is interesting too I like the grim dark look and that it is in some ruins of a great city.  Option H I like the forest motif and how the fire is glowing with people around it.  H is unique too with the desert biome but other than the partial built buildings there wasn't much to grab my attention.  F I didn't like the look of the lava flows, it seemed poorly illustrated with the colors and doesn't intrigue me.  And an area with giant flowers is a bit overdone and doesn't make me want to explore more."
651,Male,$61-100k,Black,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,I like option B the best because I like that the image provikes a midevil era fortress that looks like there could be many areas to explore.  I like option E because I think that it looks interesting how the people are living among the rocks.  The journey up to the cloud city would be very interesting as well as the anticipation of expecting what to find in the cloud city.  Option H would be intersting due to the forest aspect.  Option F looks different due to the large flower looking fauna.  Option F looks really creepy exploring the underground cave area.  Options D and G look too gloomy for me.
652,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,"I most want to explore G because of the color of the environment. I think it looks really mystical, and I would like to know the secrets of the area. H also feels very mystical and magical, and I feel like there would be lots of interesting things to learn. A also seems like a great fantasy castle to explore, and would have some interesting backstory."
653,Female,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,"I thought the lush landscapes and the cloud city were coolest. The dungeon is fun. The rest I feel ambivalent about and the dry, desert or barren lands most so."
654,Male,$101k+,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,,,"H was the one that grabbed my attention the most. I got a sense of mystery, adventure, and magic from it immediately, all of which are appealing to me. A and B had grand senses of fantasy adventure, which I like. E looked like a fun adventure that was more grounded in reality. A lot of the others were either too confusing or unclear to immediately grab my interest."
655,Female,$0-30k,White,Less than High School Diploma,35-44,,,This one looks like it embodies the start of a journey. It feels very communal. It isn__ as scary as the others.
656,Male,$61-100k,Black,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,"I'd most likely go with Option G or D in terms of exploration. I prefer landscapes that are fairly open because they tend not to have linear paths link indoor environments for example E. I'd expect there would be a few rooms and that's it. With G I feel like I could run into anything, anywhere in that area."
657,Male,$31-60k,Black,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,I think that this darker atmosphere would be more interesting to explore.
658,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,,,"C looks the most interesting to me, and E gives off a western feel. I think that__ be a real fun one to explore as well. Good options here."
659,Male,$31-60k,Black,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,"Options H,C and A look like vibrant landscape that would have rich details and look amazing. Options B,G,D,F and E would definitely have darkness, but still come off vibrant in a way that would make you excited to explore these lands."
660,Male,$61-100k,Hispanic,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,A looks the most magical
661,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,i would like to explore the world in the game in option C because of the unique style and sense of wonder
662,Male,$0-30k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,Option A shows how there is an upper and underworld a sense of two worlds colliding with one another.
663,Male,$31-60k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,,,"The giant flowers in my top choice look whimsical and interesting, which is appealing. The storms in my second choice are also striking. Very cool for sure!"
664,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,"The color scheme reminds me of a game from way back when called ""The Dig"".  Due to this association, this is my top pick"
665,Female,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,,,My absolute favorite is Option E because I love Ancient civilizations and it interests me very much. My second best is Option B because of its old and mysterious castle full of secrets to reveal. I also like Option A very much because of its fairy-tale appearance. Other options follow in the mentioned order.
666,Female,$61-100k,Hispanic,Graduate Degree,35-44,,,B because has a very strong degree of mysticism and darkness to it that makes it a more enticing setting and storyline.
667,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,I chose option C as the world that I would like to explore because I think that it looks like it is magical and a little bit surreal.  I think it would be fun to explore that world and see all of the things in it.  A world like this that is so different than our real world seems like it would be magical and easy to get lost in the game exploring it and enjoying it.
668,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,,,"Almost all of these look like generic fantasy landscapes, and don't really have many unique features.  The giant flower world looks cool though."
669,Male,$31-60k,White,Graduate Degree,25-34,,,I picked this because it looks go magical. The floating city would be fun to go up into. I would love to look down on the world from up above. I am sure there are plenty of magical buildings in it to see. I would choose E second because it looks like some ancient ruins that you might see on Earth. I am a big fan of history so this looks like something that might go down that path. I would choose C third because it looks like an Avatar world which is a movie that I like and a world that I would love to explore
670,Female,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,,,"Option H reminds me of quest adventures like LOTR and King's The Dark Tower--I love these and I love this illustration. Options D, F and B all look like super-scary worlds that are thrill-packed and intriguing. Options C, G, E and A look a bit cliched and derivative and none of these fill me with much nascent excitement. The quality of the drawing is high for all of them--well done!"
671,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,,,"I prefer the brighter and more colorful options. A and E look especially fun because they have evidence of civilizations. It just seems like there would be more to find and explore in those. A is especially cool. I want to get to that city on top. H, F, B, and D are too dark. I don__ like when video games have too much darkness"
672,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,I definitely prefer scenery that is more alive and approachable as opposed to the dark and ominous locations.  I feel like protecting the green and healthy environments is a more enticing theme than surviving the dark the environments.
673,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,,,"I prefer the images that are darker and appear to be more open world.  I would like to explore in the dark, and encounter the types of creatures that are active at that time."
674,Male,$31-60k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,,,It is in the intersection of different types of art.
675,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,,,I think the exploration of an ancient city would be the most interesting because it is inferred that there would be ancient secrets and treasures to find. I find the color choices on most of the other images to be too one-note with emphasis on a single color or too bright for the setting.
676,Female,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,"I would be most excited to explore option C game because, from what I can tell looking at image presented, there is a fantasy theme and it looks magical in a positive way, like a fairy tale and adventure, I like vibrant colors."
677,Female,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,,,I chose B as my top choice because it looks like castle ruins and there could be so many areas and traps in this building that it would be good and almost like an escape room scenario.
678,Male,$0-30k,White,High School,35-44,,,Some amazing detail and would live to explore these more. Even the last one offers something different. Love the look of the cavernous castle like stairwells. Thats a favorite for sure.
679,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,25-34,,,"I liked the theme of E and the appeal to history and ancient civilization that it made me feel. I also liked the dark and scary nature of D and B and the strong emotions they spark. F was cool looking and interesting from a technology perspective, while the others didn__ have much appeal to me in terms of the themes they tried to convey."
680,Male,$61-100k,Hispanic,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,I like the darkness and mystery of the looks of B and F. C is bright and colorful which attracts me. E seems like an ancient ruin. H has something going with it as far as that fire. D is also dark and I like to search for things in dark places. A and G seems like they are placed in the heavens.
681,Male,$0-30k,Black,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,Option A looks more appealing because it looks like a castle in Heaven. The other ones look like Hell
682,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,"E - I really like the historical aspect and would have the most fun exploring that world. B - This appears to be creepy but with a lot of fun places to go and see. D - Another creepy location, I would be interested to see what kind of things I could find. A - The cloud city intrigues me, I am curious about the difference between it and what is below. F - This seems to be almost like hell, I am not sure what all I could do in that world. C - This seems to fantasy like to me, while it could be enjoyable that is not what I typically enjoy. H - I feel like this is too much of a fantasy world with magic and is too nice. G - I can't really understand what this world is, seems too magic centric for me."
683,Female,$0-30k,Other,High School,35-44,,,"I think I leaned more toward B, E, and A because they feel more like involving environments with lots of long-forgotten nooks and crannies to explore. They also feel like they'd be more dynamic and risky because they feel like places filled with secrets, traps, and troops, adding a feeling of immersion and danger. Places like F and D feel pretty flat and too wide open and like there really isn't much to explore and investigate. At least with C, H, and G they're visually appealing and feel more full in the sense of there's something going on in the form of wildlife or weird weather."
684,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,I think C is the coolest with giant flowers. It is also the option that I can imagine most completely because of the smell of giant roses and other flowers makes me feel like it would smell beautiful in the world/forest
685,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,35-44,,,"all of these are incredible, i would like to play every single one of them.  I like the cloud city a lot in A, but I would keep all for consideration"
686,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,I ranked them based on how cool and mysterious the different settings look to me. The color of the environment makes me think of maybe what elements would be present in the area and I was drawn to A G and H especially. F B and D I was not so interested in because they just kind of look like caves to me
687,Female,$31-60k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,,,"H looks like the most unique of the bunch.  I've never been in a world like that before on a game.  C is also different.  I like that it's bright.  I feel the same about E.  It's bright and easy to see.  I can imagine what might be hiding in the cliffs.  G, A, and B are nothing special.  I've explored worlds like those before.  F is so dark, but the rocks are interesting.  D is uninteresting."
688,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,Option A leads me to imagine what lies ahead and stimulates my creativity.  I would be excited and engaged while playing there.
689,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,I like the strong contrast of colors and familiar long and wide landscapes.
690,Female,$31-60k,White,High School,35-44,,,"Options G,A,C, and H look the most fun to look at so I would want to visit those places.  Options E,F,B, and D look very creepy."
691,Male,$0-30k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,I like the environment in option H the best. The environment looks mystical and interesting to explore. I like the vibrant colors and natural surrounding. I dislike the environment in option D the most. It looks dreary and too dark. It also looks too dangerous.
692,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,,,Some of these are really cool. F is great because it looks dark and mysterious. A feels akin to Cloud City in Empire Strikes Back. And I love the purple lightning in G.
693,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,I like how real E and D look. I feel like they have a quality of depth and realness that the others do not.
694,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,,,"I like C the best because it looks unique and very interesting. I would love to explore that world. H draws me in because of the scenery. G looks like it might be a turbulent world to explore. F, B, and D look to be dark worlds full of surprises. Maybe they are all connected in some way. I'm not sure about A. It might be a fun world, but it might end up being boring as well. E is my least favorite because I generally don't like dessert worlds."
695,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,"A looks really interesting to explore, I like the castle in the clouds idea.  B looks cool as well, I like the dark castle look.  E looks interesting but maybe too mundane like it could be something in the real world.  D looks too barren to be fun to explore.  G looks like it would be too dangerous to explore and C looks boring, I'm not interested in being that size.  H is some people camping, I can do that in real life and F seems like it would run afoul of convection."
696,Female,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,"the kinds of places that interest me the most are ones that dont look like doom and peril but have a lot of layers to them. The one I ranked first I like because it's light and bright and could possibly have some exciting and happy things in it, but also lots of layers to it and lots of opportunity for challenges and danger along the way."
697,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,I like option E because it is well lit. I like seeing where I'm going and what I'm doing. I also like that it looks very historic which provides a lot of value.
698,Male,$31-60k,White,Graduate Degree,25-34,,,"I like g and a the best because the it looks like there is mysterious power in the weather and I think that is an interesting concept to be explored. Options c, b and f look uninspired and nonunique."
699,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,"I ranked B highest as it seems like a cool dungeon maze with a lot of interesting caverns and corners. Option E seems like a fun, archeological dig with the potential for adventure. Option C would be a great physical adventure like an anime film. Option F would be scary but interesting with its unsteady ground. Option H seems like an intriguing night time story sharing experience. Option G seems less fun than the higher ranked options and almost like an apocalypse. Options A and D are certainly lively but there seems to be something off about the world and I would not want to spend a lot of time in it."
700,Male,$61-100k,Black,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,"I like option A the best because the character looks really creepy.  The same can be said for options G, B, E, and D."
701,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,"I'd like to face off against H because they look dangerous but also not too sinister with their weaponry. E would be a great opponent too with the bulky almost beetle like armor. I love the color of the top trim.  G looks great too with the accents near it's arms that go well with the scythe. F I like that it is on a mount but dislike the light on it's helmet.  B has a great pose and color set but the face looks off or out of proportion. D is a good take on a classic hydra, no real complaints but nothing remarkable or interesting.  C I don't like how the bottom colors don't match the top. And A the colors are okay but very dark, it's just the hat with scales that looks very out of place."
702,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,"A would be the best because he is so unique, and his design really makes me want to fight him. He feels creepy and powerful. G feels fast and dangerous, and would makes a really great battle. E feels massive and powerful, like they could do a lot of damage if they got a hold of you."
703,Female,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,"I chose the first one because he seems cool to fight and possibly for tentacle fetish reasons, the second is just artistically cool to me, the others I am more ambivalent about and went in the order of 'who would I avoid least/wouldn't die fighting'"
704,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,,,"I would prefer to fight with the option D character because this character looks very impressive with so many heads. I chose options C, E, F, B, H and A second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh because I like big octopus character, the tough warrior with the cool outfit, the strong green warrior, the black wizard, the gruff warrior and the black weight holder character in that order because I prefer to fight those big creatures the most. I chose option G last because I would not want to fight with this scary looking creature with the flames coming off his elbows because it looks truly frightening."
705,Female,$0-30k,White,Less than High School Diploma,35-44,,,This one looks the most terrifying. A doesn__ seems represent time and old age. B is the most unusual and I don__ know what it means. C seems to represent the monsters and mysteries of the ocean and wants you to conquer it. D looks like your typical monster and just wants to fight. E seems more like a guardian of something deep within your self. F looks like it is there to fool you. H looks like it is there to test you.
706,Male,$101k+,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,,,"I liked a lot of these. They are scary and unique. I made my rankings according to a preference for the ones that scared me the most and made me the most curious. Characters like C and A make me want to know more about their unique powers and the mythology behind their character origins, their motives, and the world they live in. I felt similarly about B, G, and E, but I found them less clear or striking visually. Some of the elements of the others were slightly less appealing because they felt less complex or more familiar."
707,Male,$61-100k,Black,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,"All of these were very cool looking. I'd have to say I would want to go with Option A inn terms of combat. The design of the creature really sparks a lot of curiosity. I'd want to know what it does in combat and such. The same goes with Option's B,G,E and F. The others seem pretty generic."
708,Male,$31-60k,Black,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,I think that this enemy looks like it would be the biggest challenge to face because it looks like it would have a wide range of powers.
709,Male,$0-30k,Asian,Graduate Degree,35-44,,,G at first because its extremely powerful A on second because i like looks like scary magician H on third its power are meant to fight withB such a creepy creatureF I JUST WANT TO PUT THIS ON FIFTHE DONT LIKE IT THATS WHYD DONT WANT TO PLAY WITH ITS SO CREEPY TO MEC I JUST DONT WANT TO PLAY WITH ONE EYE CHARCHTERS
710,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,,,E looks like the biggest challenger to me. I like that since it would be more fun to play against and fight. I wasn__ as crazy about the octopus one.
711,Male,$31-60k,Black,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,"Options E,B,A,G and H would definitely be endgame type fights, these characters would have really hard hitting attacks and the strategy to beat would probably be hard. I imagine these options would use a lot of weapon slashing moves and use elementals type abilities to attack."
712,Male,$61-100k,Hispanic,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,C and D have cool designs and look the toughest to fight
713,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,i like the image in option D because the style looks like a combination of a hydra and a dragon
714,Male,$0-30k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,Option A of a scale shows how character is about weighing justice and making sure it is delivered.
715,Male,$31-60k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,,,"The octopus creature in my top choice looks most striking and intimidating, which is appealing. Very cool design for sure!"
716,Female,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,,,"My first choice to challenge and fight with is Option B character, with Option A following, because they seem the easiest to fight with having to beat one or two most important defensive elements. Other options, starting from option G onward, look more vague in terms of attack and defense capabilities, thus more dangerous."
717,Female,$61-100k,Hispanic,Graduate Degree,35-44,,,F because the goblin like appearance makes it very scary but also cool and takes a more unique approach
718,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,,,"The one with censors for a hat seems extremely silly.  all the rest are fine, but not particularly interesting."
719,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,"I chose option C as the one character that I would like to fight against because I like that it looks like an octopus or a Cthulhu. It is something completely different than you would see in other games, and I like that."
720,Female,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,,,"I don't want to fight against an animal, even an alien one. There is too much animal cruelty in the world as it is without reinforcing it via gaming or fantasy. Only options G and A are not animals, and each seems a scary opponent who would be a worthy nemesis."
721,Male,$31-60k,White,Graduate Degree,25-34,,,I think dragons are fun to fight against. I am a big GOT fan so i love dragons. I like that it has so many heads on one body. It would be a great challenge and I like a challenge when I am playing games. I would choose G second because I like the color design and am intrigued by him. He almost looks like he would be using magic. I can't tell if it is fire that he has around him but it looks fun to go against
722,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,,,"Options G, A and B look like final bosses. They look strong and intelligent. They seem like leaders. Choice G seemed the most intimidating to me, the most like a boss. The rest seem like lower bosses or mini bosses. The seem strong, but less intelligent. They are powerful monsters, but taking orders from choice G. F, C, and E are my least favorite. The art style is ugly"
723,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,"They are all pretty terrifying to fight against, but I would pick E and D because they seem to be the least agile and slowest.  I think that would give me the best chance to win a battle with them."
724,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,,,"I made my decisions based upon the character's weaponry and their ability to successfully fight successfully.  I looked at physical stature, as well as their clothing.  I choose the characters that would give me the most challenge."
725,Female,$0-30k,White,Graduate Degree,45-54,,,"Out of these images of characters from different games, the one I would most like to challenge and fight against is Option C because of his underwater worldliness theme and the numbers legs with electric abilities. It would be a challenge to fight against him with so many tentacles advancing on me at once, but it would be an interesting fight. The character I would least like to fight against is option B because he looks like he's wearing some sort of demonic halo over his head and an orb that seems to be able to do more danger to me than I to him. I think it would be tough to fight him and I would probably get frustrated by him. The other characters are all interesting to fight against and challenge and I would probably enjoy playing against all of them. Option D, which is my second choice I like because of the numerous heads and that being a challenge if said head throw flames or poison at me at different times-or the same time. Option F was my third choice because to fight against because are two fighters her, because one is riding the other. It would be a challenge to have to fight the beast and the character onto who is welding a sword that resembles a calligraphy pen. My fourth choice was Option E who looks to be on fire along the top of his body, does that mean he could throw fireballs at me while we fight? I think it would be interesting to see what he could do with that weapon as well. My fifth choice was Option A because of the demonic way the character looks and those scales on his head, I'd be interested in knowing what they would do in a fight.  Each character seems so different and interesting that playing against them would be a fun challenge though."
726,Male,$31-60k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,,,"It can stand alone, as a background, or be applied to other elements, like lines, shapes, textures or typography."
727,Male,$31-60k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,,,E- seems to be powerful and evil C- this has a scary outlook and which is very much appealing F- has a great design and pattern which is unique B- has a unique outfit and layout H- this seems to be very much realistic and has great outlookA- seems to be more evil and powerful by the outlook D- has a good design and layout which is very appealing G- seems to be very gentle and good outlook
728,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,,,As an enemy I prefer the strange and unusual characters. The large white demon with the scythe is the most intimidating and strong looking. The more humanoid looking characters come across as looking more frail.
729,Male,$0-30k,White,High School,35-44,,,The electricity on the first and overall look is amazing artwork. The rest are pretty bland and feel kind of common. Nothing really comes off as unique.
730,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,25-34,,,"I liked the exotic alien look of C, and I liked the mythical creature idea captured in D. I generally did not like the more human looking options like B and A because they seemed too commonplace and the features used to make them more unique felt awkward. Otherwise F, E, G and H were okay, with their colors and dark feelings being the major strengths."
731,Female,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,,,I chose G as the most interesting opponent because I wouldn't be able to tell what his attack plan would be so it would be a challenge.
732,Female,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,"I would pick option H because this creature seems more predictable in terms of how to fight it and what to expect from it, not as scary and strange, not as strong, perhaps? I am thinking here in terms of fighting against and I ranked in accordance to what I think would be easier to manage in fight. Others become more scary and unpredictable, especially unmanly creatures and those with sorcery/magic elements."
733,Male,$61-100k,Hispanic,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,G seems like they can fight with those weapons. E and H are huge and powerful to go along with their weapons. D  and B look like a powerful creatures.  F has some human element with them along with mysterious qualities. A seems very humnalike and the scales are interesting. C seems like an underwater creature which intrigues me.
734,Female,$0-30k,Other,High School,35-44,,,"I think the spookier and weirder and more obtuse-looking their power set looks like, the more intriguing they are to me. Like, I look at something like A and B and I feel like I don't know what to expect in terms of interaction and attack, their style and powers, which is exciting and more dynamic than something like H which just looks like a brawler that's just physical attacks."
735,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,E looks like the funnest battle to me. The large character reminds me of a 'souls' boss and I think it would be a fun and challenging battle. this character is the most imposing out of the options presented.
736,Male,$0-30k,Black,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,I think I have a slight chance against Option C. The other ones would kill me in 5 seconds
737,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,"I love all the designs and art style overall, but H and G specifically look like no monster I have seen in an RPG or fantasy game before, so I was drawn in to them right away. They are scary and foreboding and look to be very powerful"
738,Female,$31-60k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,,,"B reminds me of Skeletor, which was my childhood foe.  I dig the nostalgia it brings up. G looks fierce and like an alien.  D reminds me of Harry Potter, which is another favorite of mine.  H, F, and C, I like equally.  They look tough to beat.  E is weird.  And I don't like the look of A at all.  I can't figure out what it's supposed to do, power wise."
739,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,35-44,,,"the one eyed squid is by far the most unique and cool image, all of them have pros however.   i would go with the squid"
740,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,I think that Option A has the most unique design and style.  It looks like a really interested character to fight and looks like a challenge.
741,Female,$31-60k,White,High School,35-44,,,"I prefer option B or D because they caught my attention the most.  Options G,E,and F have a lot of detail in them.  Options A,C, and H are really creepy."
742,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,"I love E, H and A. I feel like the more human looking the more I like them and want to fight against them. The less human looking the less I want to fight them."
743,Female,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,because it's who i would fight against I'm thinking through who i could beat. Some of the darker more mysterious ones are harder to understand their powers so i feel like they would be harder to beat. the more obvious muscle men or lots of heads i think are a little more apparent how id need to beat them in a fight.
744,Male,$0-30k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,I would like to battle the monster in option G the most. I like his design as he looks like an agile fighter which would be fun. I dislike the monster in option C the most. Its design looks slightly creepy with the electrical tentacles.
745,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,35-44,,,"I like A and B I like equally as much, they looks cool and intimidating and weird...in a good way . C, G and D are kind of standard boss type bad guys. not main bosses but like stage bosses , they are not bad but just kind of expected. F, H , and E I do not like they just feel uninspired and kind of flat"
746,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,"I like option A because he not only looks really evil, but also looks very smart which would make it very challenging to defeat."
747,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,,,I love C. The purple and blue colors really pop. D is really cool -- I like the multiple heads and colors. F is amazing with the rich green colors and the attention to detail.
748,Male,$31-60k,White,Graduate Degree,25-34,,,"I think options c, a and b seem the most interesting and unique. Almost like they would keep me guessing as to what they might do next or make me wonder about their origin."
749,Male,$61-100k,Black,High School,35-44,,,"Options A, B and G are my top 3 choices as they most resemble what a classic video game enemy would appear like.  Option A having a justice scale built in his head is scary, as it makes me feel like he would be deciding when my time runs out. Options B and G seem like they would have magical powers and weapons, and would be overall strong characters,"
750,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,"I like H because it really stands out with the glow and overall style. It is my favorite. I also really like G, because it is really cute. That would be another great option to play as.  E feels like it would have some great abilities, and would add a lot of variety to the game play."
751,Male,$61-100k,Black,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,"I like option F the best for the flying quality of the charachter, which would add another element and compliment our fighting styles.  I also like that there is a wise look to the face of the character.  I also like options D, B, C, and G for their flying qualities as well.  I like options H, E, and A because they look like they could be fast and stealthy while running.  I also like that all three have a magic vibe to them as well."
752,Female,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,I like the ones that are catlike with wings because I feel like they can defend me but also take me places. The snake is cool but has no legs and he might murder me.
753,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,"I love how soft F looks and the pose with chest puffed out.  H I love the luminescent blue look to it, though I dislike the lack of feet. G is very cute but I don't like the stance. E I really like the blue harness but the face is too narrow.  D has a great color combination and looks almost like an Asian influenced being, but I felt like the whiskers were a bit out of proportion with the tail.  C looks familiar and I like the gradient of the colors but it looks too mean.  B I don't like the coloring of the feathers or what it is perched on. And A just looks flat and I really dislike the teal fangs and spikes."
754,Male,$0-30k,Hispanic,Vocational Training,25-34,,,"I like the hand drawn, large outlines of this animal, and the colors work together great."
755,Male,$101k+,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,,,"Many of these were difficult to see and understand exactly what I was looking at. I had a preference for the ones that were clearer images that were easier to understand. D had the most distinct features and conveyed a sense of power and loyalty that appealed to me the most out of all of them. F was similarly appealing, but slightly less identifiable. H may have been the coolest and most memorable design, but it took a little more time and studying to process."
756,Female,$0-30k,White,Less than High School Diploma,35-44,,,This one looks the most wise and comfortable with itself. They all embody a friendly attitude towards the player. H really stands out in design and is unusual.
757,Male,$61-100k,Black,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,I think Option b just looks the best out of the lot. I t has a interesting design and overall look.
758,Male,$31-60k,Black,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,This character looks more unique than what you would expect in games for companions and I think it would be the most interesting to have as one.
759,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,,,I prefer realism so I like the green dragon the best. I like characters that may exist in real life. All good possible options though
760,Male,$0-30k,Asian,Graduate Degree,35-44,,,i ranked the characters according to my likeness based on their powers and shapes and appearance.i selected F at first because i want a companion like this with  huge wings with grace and selected B at the end because i liked it at the end
761,Male,$31-60k,Black,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,"I like that options D,E,A and F have a toughness to their designs, but at the same time a cute and loyal look that would definitely make them trustworthy friends/partners."
762,Male,$61-100k,Hispanic,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,H is pretty and D is the coolest looking
763,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,i would like to be a companion of the creature in option B because it looks strong but very friendly
764,Male,$0-30k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,Option H looks like a mixture of future and past to create a sense both are connected always.
765,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,I prefer option D because it reminds me of a wild cat. I also have a cat as a companion. None of the other options are realistic enough for me to relate to in that regard.
766,Male,$31-60k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,,,"The blue deer in my top choice is striking and interesting, which is appealing. The griffin in my second choice looks epic and cool for sure!"
767,Female,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,,,"My favorite is Option F companion because it does not seem scary yet powerful enough and it can also fly high. Option D is my second best because it`s also powerful and not too scary. The following options are either too cute and friendly for a reliable companion, or too wild and independent to rely on."
768,Male,$0-30k,White,Less than High School Diploma,35-44,,,I think C looks very detailed and feels like it has a fantasy connection compared to most of them on here.
769,Female,$61-100k,Hispanic,Graduate Degree,35-44,,,A because the colors are very detailed and animated on A. I also think the display is very engaging and ultra fitting.
770,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,I chose option C as the one that I would like to be my companion because I like that it looks like a cross between a snake and a dragon.  I think both of those things are cool and together I think it looks the best out of all of these options.
771,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,,,I don't care for the tiny cute ones.  Just give me a dragon.
772,Female,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,,,"I like the more cartoonish animals because it does not make me scared that a real animal could be hurt by my actions. Option G is cute and friendly,  option D and F appeal because of my love of cats,  and option H reminds me of Christmas and the north pole--up to this point, any of the four would be great. E, C, B and A look more evil than good--I would be scared rather than heartened to fight beside them."
773,Male,$31-60k,White,Graduate Degree,25-34,,,I would definitely want something that can fly. I would get me around a lot easier. I really like dragons so I picked C. It would be able to take me where I want and also strike fear in my enemies. I would choose C second because I like that it looks like a flying lion. It would be soft to pet but also be able to fight very well. I would choose F third because it also looks like something that would be soft and friendly to me but fight my enemies real well
774,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,,,"I like the little guy in G. He__ cute and looks like he could ride on my shoulder. At the same time he looks like he__ hiding some powers. He__ like a Pokémon. The rest seem too big and unwieldy. They are too much. They also aren__ cute and don__ seem like they__ want to listen to me. D, C, B, and A look like they might want to eat me"
775,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,"I would want a strong and powerful companion who could protect me, but also one that looks friendly.  D definitely has the best combination of both."
776,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,,,I made my decisions based upon the character's weaponry and their ability to successfully defeat the enemy while fighting alongside of me.  I looked at physical stature and how imposing they look.
777,Male,$31-60k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,,,It has the key characteristics of all characters.
778,Male,$61-100k,White,High School,35-44,,,The blue deer looking thing looks amazing to me!
779,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,,,"I prefer the four legged choices as a companion. Not only could they fight at my side, but they would be perfect to ride as well. The one with the blue crystals is my favorite because of how intimidating it looks without being too large like some of the other choices."
780,Female,$0-30k,White,Graduate Degree,45-54,,,"Out of all the images of characters from various games, the one I would most like to be my companion in a game is Choice B because it looks like a creature I would be able to ride on, and his face seems fierce and loyal . My second choice, Option F feels the same almost - I would be able to ride him for faster travel, however he doesn't seem as fierce and protective. Option E was my third choice because the elements of his composition make him look fast and powerful. H was my fourth choice because of the otherworldliness of the creature and its use of magic, then comes Choice C which I liked because it looked fierce, but I didn't really like because of the way its body is half bird-half snake. It doesn't look like it would fly far off the ground, and it might be a hinderance in game play as my companion. A was my next choice, which seems fierce but as my companion, those spike would be an issue, then my seventh and eighth choice was D and G, and for both of them they reminded me of cute stuffed animals with lots of fur and adorableness. I'm not sure I would want to go on an adventure with them to fight evil or whatever we'd be up against."
781,Female,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,,,I chose D as my top pick because the character looks like a loyal companion.  It gives me the feeling of being looked over. Most of the top picks were mostly guardian looking characters.
782,Female,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,"I prefer option F because this creature reminds me of ""The Never Ending Story"" movie Falkor dragon a little bit, this makes it endearing and relatable. Overall  I like other dragons here, as well. H is very attractive character and intriguing but I am not sure what it's strengths might be."
783,Male,$61-100k,Hispanic,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,C seems like a very mythical and powerful creature. A could help as it is very powerful. B seems like it has the ability to be versatile. H seems like it is very mysterious. D is very large which can be helpful to me. EFG are creatures that I am just not sure what they can do in order to help me out due to size or something else.
784,Male,$0-30k,White,High School,35-44,,,Love the finer details on the first couple. This really brings them to life. The last couple lack this and come off more cartoon like which puts them a step behind.
785,Female,$0-30k,Other,High School,35-44,,,"A is definitely my lowest rank in that the color palette is pretty cold and grim, and it just looks very unfriendly and unapproachable.H is kind of interesting but overall feels too cold and distant/removed, like it's too ephemeral to relate to and feels like there wouldn't be the possibility for an emotional connection.C is beautiful but I think because of the lack of limbs it feels a bit too alien and unrelatable to feel like you could make a connection to it. I do love the wings and the feeling of ancientness to it, like it feels like a creature from Atzec or Mayan lore.B is kind of a similar reaction to C but feels a bit warmer and more approachable because of the color palette. It also feels more agile and versatile in how it can mobilize with the presence of both wings and legs, which feels more tactically appealing.D feels more familiar with the feline element and has a good balance of cuddly/approachable and majestic, and I like the kind of Chinese flair it's got going. E edges D out because it's so weird. Like, part squirrel, part deer, part owl. It's so bizarre you can't help but love it.G feels very cuddly and appealing in that it feels like you could pick it up and cuddle with it, which is nice for a companion.F ranks at the very top because it's got such an alien feel to it but it's still appealingly accessible and cuddly and it somehow feels both awkward and majestic with it's strange proportions. I also love that it can travel well on the ground and through the air."
786,Male,$0-30k,Black,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,Option D is my favorite because it looks very powerful while still looking dignified
787,Male,$31-60k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,,,A- this seems to be powerful and strongD- this has a great outlook and design which is appealing E- this seems to be having enormous power and skills C- has a lot of great design and outlook to it G- seems to be calm and dangerous H- has a simple and great appearance F- this has a great outlook and representation is very appealing B- this seems to be clean and cute
788,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,25-34,,,"I liked the wise and intelligent facial expressions present in D and F along with their look of experience. Next I felt that E and A conveyed strength and powerful that would appeal in a companion. In contrast H and G would be my lowest choices because they looked weak, and too cutesy to be effective."
789,Female,$101k+,Asian,Graduate Degree,35-44,,,I chose based on a simple criteria what looks good and also what looks most helpful.  To me choice D was the best of the bunch it looks nimble fast and powerful and would make an excellent companion. Options F & C are equal to me as they both look like they would make great companions and they seem nimble of course having wings helps. I am not exactly sure what option A is but it looks pretty cool love the colors and the horns and it looks angry so it would make a good companion for sure.  I like the colors of option B and its wings help for sure. Option H is personally the best looking companion but this starts what i consider the weakest companions and H is the best of the bottom choices.  E and G are tied to me they dont look like they would make very good companions at all.
790,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,"to have a companion on a game the most important thing is to be, or look like a badass, i dont want a fluffy companion"
791,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,I prefer F because it reminds me of Falcor from the never ending story and that elicits a huge wave of nostalgia to me. Additionally D is similar but lesser extend due to the coloring
792,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,"G is far and away the cutest of all of the options and would make for a fun companion. After that, I ranked them based on how good of a steed or mount each creature would make."
793,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,35-44,,,"im gonna go against my normal choices of picking the most detailed and pick G.  I think that even though some of the others are more in depth looking, there is something about G that seems like it would be a memorable character.    Something that brings wisdom and light"
794,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,I re ally love the design of option B.  The colors are really cool and the model looks fun to play with.  I would feel more immersed and engaged with option B.
795,Female,$31-60k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,,,"The eyes get me in G.  It's just awfully cute.  E is also adorable.  Plus, it looks extra loyal.  H is mystical.  I dig that.  F reminds me of The Neverending Story.  I like the kick of nostalgia that it brings.  B looks like a fierce dragon, which I like.  D and C also resemble dragons, but they aren't as nifty as B.  I'm not a fan of A.  It looks more like an enemy than a game companion."
796,Female,$31-60k,White,High School,35-44,,,"Options B,G,H, and D look very pretty.  Options F,A,E,C look like nature."
797,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,"B/F/C are the best because they can fly.  B is very regal looking.  F is a little too cat looking for me, I don't like cats.  C has something wrong with its face.A is decent looking for a non flyer.  D looks regal but has some cat face going on that looks out of place.  H is okay but is a prey animal.  G and E just look kind of goofy and out of place with the rest of these guys."
798,Female,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,"I was looking for companions that would be the most helpful to me. the one i ranked first appears to be something i could potentially ride, and it has antlers to fight with, and it also has a scroll so i could possibly use it for sending and receiving important messages."
799,Male,$0-30k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,I like the companion in option F the best. I like how it can fly and has a large body. It looks reliable and tough. I dislike the companion in option G the most. It looks too small and frail.
800,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,,,"I like B the best because the girl looks like a warrior. I especially like the toe spikes, and the sickle weapon. I like the Thor hammer on option G. Option D reminds me of Gru from the Guardians movie, and also a character from Lords Mobile. Option A is like an Ice princess that could spell you. C,F, and E are odd because they are animals in human form. H I definitely wouldn't fight side by side with death."
801,Female,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,"Generally I like the greenery focused ones, I think they're the most creative. I don't like the skull one, it feels a bit lame. I like the ones that seem like strong lesbians also for whatever reason because it feels refreshing to see."
802,Male,$61-100k,Black,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,"I like option C the best and would pick this character to fight side by side with because the character looks like they could not be defeated easily and could be a good fighter due to their strength and size.  I like options F, B, and G for the same qualities only they descend with each option.  I like opion E for thier flying quality.  Option A I like because they look to have magical powers.  Option D looks interesting and has some magical qualities as well.  Option H looks really creep and looks to wield some magical qualities and sorcery as well."
803,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,"I like G because she looks strong and powerful, which makes her the most interesting.  D is very colorful and unique, and I would like them as a secondary character. F also seems very powerful and has a cool look, and he would make a great secondary character, as well."
804,Male,$0-30k,White,High School,25-34,,,Prefer feminine characters
805,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,"I'd love to fight along C because of how unusual they are.  It looks like a white ram turned into bipedal form and I love the hammer.  D looks great too, like a bush come to life, I especially like the shape of it.  G looks like a classic companion and I really like her viking look and hair. B has a fierce look with fiery hair which I love, and a short stature which makes me think they are a dwarf of some sort. E I love the black wings and how it contrasts against the rest of their garb.  F I think looks like some sort of orc with the green skin but I don't like their helmet or clothing colors.  A is too monotone, but I do like the antlers. And H is too evil looking and malevolent. I like the floating runes but not in both hands."
806,Male,$0-30k,White,High School,25-34,,,"I like the outfits of the characters in choices G and B. I like the human characters the most and I like the weapon in choice G. The other designs did not jump out as much to me , but I like choices D, E and C because they have unique designs, especially choice D which looks like a walking tree. I like choice C and how powerful the character is depicted. Choices H , F, and A are not too memorable for me."
807,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,,,"I would prefer to fight with the option E character because this character can fly and looks very impressive with his wings spread out. I chose options C, G, F, B, H and A second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh because I like big brute ram-horned character, the tough warrior woman with the nice outfit, the strong green warrior, the small female with axe, the powerful black necromancer and the white forest wizard in that order because I prefer to fight with strong warrior types more than wizard types. I chose option D last because I would not want to fight with this large forest creature with the large leaves because our party would have no inherent stealth with such a large and bulky creature."
808,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,"Option G is my favorite one because it's an eye-catching design yet also looks powerful. I would like a stronger weapon however. Option A is too bland, with a cliche design."
809,Male,$101k+,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,,,"H was the most visually striking, and I found it scary and interesting. It was the character I wanted learn more about the most. G felt powerful and loyal and reminded me of games and stories that I tend to like or find interesting. C looked the most powerful and intimidating. C looked intriguing and appeared to have one of the more interesting backstories and worlds. Many of the others were confusing to look at or did not immediately grab my interest because of the lack of distinctive or interesting elements for me."
810,Female,$0-30k,White,Less than High School Diploma,35-44,,,This one looks like they have some powerful and secretive magic. They seem more moral and comfortable with their selves than the others.
811,Male,$61-100k,Black,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,I'd say it's a tie between Option E and H. They look the coolest out of the eight Options and I'd want to know what they do in combat. All of the other characters don't really get much intrigue out of me.
812,Male,$31-60k,Black,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,This chaacter looks like it would have the most varied skillset and that it would be able to complement the player better/
813,Male,$0-30k,Asian,Graduate Degree,35-44,,,I selected the options based on the likeness of each character. If I would be using these characters in gaming I would be choosing them in this order.
814,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,,,I would like to fight next to the ones with the giant mallet weapons. They seem like they would do the most damage and would be the most helpful to fight next to.
815,Male,$31-60k,Black,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,"I like option A a lot, she looks to be a healer and could hold her own with amazing shiny attacks that look really cool and bright. Options G,B and C look like you typical warriors, but they look really strong. Options D,E and H are good, but not that tough in my opinion, I do like the designs though and the color schemes are nice."
816,Male,$61-100k,Hispanic,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,E is cool and I like it's wings
817,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,i would be willing to fight side by side with the character in option G because he looks like zelda
818,Male,$0-30k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,"Option E looks like a dark angel. A mix of good and evil, that there is not absolute."
819,Male,$31-60k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,,,"The green ogre in my top choice looks wise, which is appealing. The purple pentagrams used in my second choice are also appealing. Very cool design for sure!"
820,Female,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,,,"It would definitely be Option E character because it seems very reliable, confident and equipped with visible and hidden advantages and trump cards. My second best is Option D character because of its power to merge with the environment, i.e. by hiding what is an important element in both offensive and defensive strategy. Other options follow in the mentioned order."
821,Female,$61-100k,Hispanic,Graduate Degree,35-44,,,C has the most amazing and eclectic detail that follows a strong and very unique form.
822,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,I chose option H as my favorite to fight alongside with because I think the character looks like death and would be a great fighter.  I also like that they appear to be able to use magic which I think is a great power to have.
823,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,,,"I really like the ram, the antler elf woman, and the two forest characters.  The others aren't as interesting, and some are just plain."
824,Female,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,,,"Images D, E, F and C are well-drawn but nonhuman and otherworldly. There may be story elements that would make me want to fight by their side, but none of that is conveyed by the art along. Option H is slightly human, but not by much. Option B is intriguing but too male/masculine for my taste. Option G reminds me of Conan, looks like a good and true companion, but I want to fight with a female. And that leaves option A, the only choice that can be clearly identified as female."
825,Male,$31-60k,White,Graduate Degree,25-34,,,I would choose her as my first choice because she looks the most real. I like that she has human characteristics. She also looks like she would fight well. I like the big hammer she fights with and the overall outfit. She also has some sex appeal to her and it always helps to fight alongside a sexy companion. I would choose C second because he looks like he could do the most damage. I like the ram head and also looks like he could wield the hammer really well and forcefully
826,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,,,"C, G, and B seem like the best side kicks to me. They seem strong and loyal. They also look ready to go. F and A look a little bored, like they don__ want to be there. E, D, and H look more like enemies that I would battle. I like C the best. I like the personality he exudes. he seems bigger than me, but he looks like he is ready to by my partner"
827,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,,,"I made my decisions based upon the character's weaponry and their ability to successfully defeat the enemy while fighting alongside of me.  I looked at physical stature, as well as their clothing."
828,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,"I really like A, and to a lesser extent H, because they seem to rely on mystical powers as opposed to size and strength.  I feel like they would have a variety of abilities to help in battle, instead of just being big and powerful, and that variety would help more against all different types of enemies."
829,Male,$31-60k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,,,It is in the intersection of different types of art.
830,Male,$61-100k,White,High School,35-44,,,The first two options I selected seem more realistic to me than the others.
831,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,,,"If I am meant to fight side by side with this character, then I want to be a character who is similar to my own. I like the warrior with the big hammer for this reason. The non-humanoid characters are too large and I don't feel they would be a good fit next to my own character."
832,Female,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,"I prefer option H character the most because this character looks like it is using power of magic and sorcery, besides, it has extra double tools in it's hands. It is easy to find regular weapons in games but magic is more complicated and powerful in a different and interesting way."
833,Male,$0-30k,White,High School,35-44,,,"The first 2 offer insane detail and really help the imagination and emersion. Can't stop looking at them. The last one looks like a fury heart, not sure I understand it."
834,Female,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,,,I chose H because the character looks to have an intellectual aspect to him and that would help with mental strategy.
835,Male,$61-100k,Hispanic,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,I love the size of the creature of B and the weapon it carries. I think that C is a good partner as its big and that weapon can do damage. I think G will be able to handle all battles. E is unique as they can fly. F seems like a very strong creature. H is interesting and mysterious. D seems like they are strong. A just seems very weak to me.
836,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,25-34,,,I liked D because it seemed like a strong and loyal companion that would really look out for me. B also looked very loyal and trustworthy. I then thought E and H were appealing because they seemed powerful and capable. In contrast I thought G and A would be the weakest and most limited companions.
837,Female,$0-30k,Other,High School,35-44,,,"These are all really nice designs, but keeping in mind the kind of characters I tend to play, I would want to have a partner that's a bit different and covers bases my character wouldn't. I want to see them have a different fighting style and aesthetic to me. It's why I was so drawn to H and E. They're just spooky and dark, and look like they have different skills to my typical character types. A is really beautiful and would be appealing to see performing their skills, it would be like watching an angel do battle. D and F looks like nature spirits, so they make me a bit curious about what their fighting styles would be like. The rest of them just look like basic brawlers and don't look like they would help make our pairing particularly dynamic or interesting."
838,Male,$0-30k,Black,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,"Option C is big, strong, and scary - three attributes you need for someone you want to fight alongside with"
839,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,"I ranked the images based on how new and unique I found the designs to be. I play a lot of RPGs so I can usually tell what a character is capable with just looking at them, so I like a few surprises every now and then. Looking at E and D i do not immediately know what they are all about so I am intrigued by them the most."
840,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,D and F remind me of druid type characters and I think theey would be the most reliable to fight alongside. I think they would be able to manipulate nature as an added advantage in battle.
841,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,35-44,,,"I think wings go a long way, especially in images like E.  I also like the all white look of the one with antlers."
842,Male,$0-30k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,"I would like the character in option G to fight with me. She looks like a strong, reliable and caring person. I dislike the character in option H the most. It does not look trustworthy."
843,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,Option E looks like the most interesting and unique character.  I feel like this character may have some healing abilities which would be useful in the gam.e
844,Female,$31-60k,White,High School,35-44,,,"I would want to fight alongside option A because it reminds me of elsa.  Options H,E, and D look like very detail oriented characters.  Options F,B, C and G are too creepy."
845,Female,$31-60k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,,,"G looks like it could throw down.  B has a formidable ax that could do damage.  F and D both look loveable.  Like they'd be loyal friends.  E is interesting.  I'd like to know more about it.  A looks tough as well, but would make a better foe.  I don't like C.  I'm tired of the sexy woman in games.  Make them fierce with normal bodies, please, and fully clothed.  H looks like an enemy.  I don't like that one at all."
846,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,"I love B, C, G, and E. I like how human they look and the weapons they have.  I feel they would be fun to go up against."
847,Female,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,I think that brute strength is really appealing to me as a fighter by my side because that's not necessarily something i think i'd have and would make me feel safer
848,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,,,I like G the best. She is very attractive with blonde hair and a regal look. H is interesting as well -- a cross between a magician and Skeleton. F looks like a scary comic book character.
849,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,"E and A look like they would have magic powers and also be fun to work with.  B at least is smart enough to wear armor, G should probably get some of that.  D could be interesting, I do like nature.    H looks a bit scary to work with, and C and F are shirtless in melee combat which seems like a bad combo."
850,Female,$0-30k,Hispanic,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,I ranked them by characters who look more adult and realistic. I'm not a fan of the baby like characters nor the pixar animation style. I think more realistic looking characters are usually the way to go for any game.
851,Female,$0-30k,Hispanic,High School,25-34,,,"I think that E looks cute and fresh. I like how it has a nice balance between realism and cartoonish style. I also chose B and H next since I__ a fan of the tiny and cute style of cartoon. I really liked them the second and third most. F and C are okay but they feel a bit bland and generic for me. D,G and A just don__ really wow me and I don__ really like their styles. I feel like they are to rough and strange looking."
852,Female,$31-60k,White,High School,45-54,,,I votedaccording to how i would chose in my game
853,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,,,"I prefer the option G wizard character art style because I like the realistic look of his face and bear and clothing in this image. I chose options D, C, A, H, F and E second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh because I like the large muscles on this option D fighting character and the size and shape of his hands and legs more than realistic colors and clothing style of this option C pirate who looks rather small while the option A alien looks odd with no nose and large eyes and the option H character has legs that are too short and not realistic and the option F character is not wearing enough clothes and the option E character looks too much like a princess and has too much blush on her face. I chose option B last because the red hair of this character is much too large and bushy and the suitcase and large coat do not seem very useful for this character to be holding and wearing."
854,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,I liked options A and H the best because they looked cute but it was also easy to imagine the world they would be from.
855,Female,$0-30k,White,Less than High School Diploma,35-44,,,This one is more realistic. It makes the audience relate to them more. It makes the story their in seem more real. They are likely to listen to the story that is being portrayed. They will learn from this.
856,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,,,Option D because it doesn't look like a little kids game and is detailed.
857,Male,$0-30k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,"Option C is a really engaging and fun art style that'll always look good and sticks out a lot on any screen size. Their details make them have a healthy mix of cute and serious, giving them a lot of personality."
858,Male,$61-100k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,I liked choice D since the color scheme of the character looks the most appealing and the way the character looks confident. Choice G looks more plain and not as eye catching with the facial expression.
859,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,,,"The style of A seems out of context and I would need to see more but I hate this character. I really can't stand the childish style of B or H. It is really hard to take the character in G seriously.  Although I hate the use of Magenta in F, this character shows artistic promise. From an artistic sense I do not love D, but I think he looks scrappy and could match a great storyline. The character from C looks ready for adventure. The character from E has a very high-end look and she looks really professionally done."
860,Female,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,"I prefer the most option A because this character looks intriguing, mysterious, interesting, even cute but could be dangerous - this is why I would want to see it and find out more about it. And F is at the very bottom of the list because I do not think that this character should be in a cartoon at all, it does not feel fitting, looks too ""exposed"" clothing wise."
861,Male,$61-100k,Black,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,I like option H the best because I like the art style that shows the characters to look more cartoon-like due to how ther body features are changed in a way that makes them look cute.
862,Male,$61-100k,Black,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,"I think Option D & B are the ones that I would prefer to see in a game. All the other styles are cool and all but they are styles that you see pretty much everywhere. Option's D and B stand out so much because I haven't seen them. If I had to choose between D and B, I'd likely go with D because the proportions of the character is a big more realistic."
863,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,,,"I like the ones that are simple and interesting, and not overly realistic or cute."
864,Female,$61-100k,Hispanic,Graduate Degree,35-44,,,H and D are my top choices. I like the contrast between sweet and innocent and strong and mighty.
865,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,i prefer the art style in option E because the character looks the most realistic and attractive
866,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,"I like C because it is a proportional person but it is also clearly cartoonish.  I think those types of characters are relatable, but also can still be capable of non-human actions and experiences."
867,Male,$0-30k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,"Options D and C look more like a dark hero, one that people can relate to and not be all glitz and glory."
868,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,,,There is a strong element of realism in the character of the old wizard. By looking at his face I can see his determination and power. This artwork does a good job of expressing the thoughts of the character while remaining realistic in its depiction.
869,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,Option F is a cool girl who stands out. She__ big. She__ hip. Option E is a beautiful well put together young lady. Going down the line option D looks imposing with his two axes. I do not like option A because there is no realism there and I don__ like option g because I don__ want to se an old gray haired man in a game.
870,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,I like option F because the character looks very realistic and shows a lot of skin. Those are my favorite types of designs.
871,Female,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,,,"I chose H, B, and E as my top three choices because I like the rounded look to the characters. They look charming and happy. I would choose games that have these types of characters because I think they would be a fun type of game."
872,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,"i like funny, over size, kind of like caricature"
873,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,35-44,,,"I like the whimsical type character in A the most, I think he is novel and interesting"
874,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,"G is my favorite style as it is fairly realistic but with simple cartoon shading. D I do not like the exaggerated mid-section, but it at least looks versatile and with personality. A is alright, but the shading looks lacking in depth to give the character life. F's shading looks OK and I appreciate the more realistic proportions however I hate the character example which colors my view. C, B, H, and E I hate because I feel it looks overly like a cheap, low-budget, poorly-made 3D cartoon for kids. C looks the least awful as the proportions aren't chibi or anything crazy. B I like for similar reasons as C, however I dislike the way the eyes are styled as it makes the character look like it has mental issues. H, I hate the oversized head and proportions in general.  E is the worst as it looks like a cheap straight to video children's film."
875,Male,$61-100k,Hispanic,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,I love the characters that take on a more realistic human form. I also like ones that have a decent size to them so you get to see more details. So to me the best ones are G F and E. They all fit those things that I am looking for.
876,Male,$0-30k,Black,Associate Degree,35-44,,,"F looks close to realistic enough for me. D has a great warrior look. G looks serious and I like the old wizard look. Yes A is cartoony, but I love the look of the character. The rest are too cartoony looking for me."
877,Male,$0-30k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,I like the style of option F the best. The size of the character looks large and realistic which is appealing compared to the other designs.
878,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,"I like the Gandalf the White style on this image.  I would play a game with these proportions and style.    E looks reasonable too, I like that it has normal proportions and appears to be original.  H is kind of cute I might play a game with that ascetic. maybe let my kids play it.    D could be interesting."
879,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,I like the cartoony but realistic style better than super realistic or super cartoony.
880,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,I like the dark and sinister style of the dual wielding fighter in D the most. The old wizard in G is my second favorite because I love his unique style. The girl in F is interesting and would be my third choice. The remaining options don__ really appeal to me because they look too silly.
881,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,"I don't like option f because she's trying to be sexy, option a isn't human, and g is way too old.The best ones so our character that is pretty realistic, human, and unique."
882,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,"The styles that I preferred, I preferred because they are more cartoony and seem more fun. I'm not looking for realistic, I'm looking for something that will be fun. Option H made me think the game is for little kids and I really didn't like it."
883,Male,$61-100k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,21-24,,,"Characters B and C are the best since they have a toony yet realistic look to them. They are not an overused style than most other games that have exagerated body proportions. Option B is the best but is very close to option C, I massively prefer their art styles over the others."
884,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,I really love C and D they look cute but have weapons and look like they would be fun to play with.  G looks way to serious. The rest I don't like at all they look to incent.
885,Female,$0-30k,White,High School,21-24,,,"option A's details take me to simple graphics and it brings me sense of comfort because it looks like an old school cartoon. Option H looks cute, and there is a lot of potencial in making cute graphics with badass qualities. Option G is more mature and has more details but it's still on the simpler side. Option C's graphic makes me think that there'll be a lot of cool effects around the characters and their mannerisms. Every game now looks like option D and F now. I don't see option E for a game and option B is cute but it depends on which game you want to put it because the graphic does not work for all game categories."
886,Female,$31-60k,Black,High School,25-34,,,I think that character F has the right amount of realism while still looking like a cartoon character.
887,Female,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,25-34,,,I think option A is cute and unique as a character. I like the characters that are a little bit more cute style than realistic.
888,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,,,I prefer the male figures for  games.  My first choice seems more capable and adventurous and will get in a fight. My second choice is more mysterious and magical but I would prefer him a little less lifelike. My third choice is interesting and looks like he is hiding special abilities.  My first woman choice look like she's up for an adventure.  The rest of the women characters are kind of boring.
889,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,f - hyper realistic - makes me feel like im in another real life world g -  also very hyper realistic so i like it for the reason as f e - still looking realistic but a tinge of cartoon. it helps me to feel immersed but not so much that i think its real d - realistic but very cartoony in body shape. i still enjoy this. b - starting to feel unrealistic and im losing interest because of that - i do enjoy her voluptuous hair though c - i like the pirate theme h - very cutesy cartoony. good for kids not for me a - its a bit scary but cute at the same thing. its confusing.
890,Female,$61-100k,White,Vocational Training,25-34,,,"I like E, H and B the best, they are well designed and have a cute factor to them that isn't to graphic or violent feeling."
891,Female,$31-60k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,,,"First choice was option A, because if I am playing a video game the character better be awesome to play.  This character reminds me of Vivi in FF8.Second choice is option D, because again, if I'm playing a video game - I want the character to be amazing and stand the test of time.  Option D is huge, manly, and carrying axes!Third and fourth choices were E and F.  Both have characters that look like little girls, one being a princess (E).  I'm not a fan of being a princess or playing as a princess.  I'm also a tiny person in real life, and prefer to play characters that are bigger and better than I am.Fifth choice was option F, because it's just pandering to the male gaze in the gaming community.  Where are her clothes?Sixth chioce was option option H, because the again this is a small male child to play.  I'm not a fan of playing small children in video games, nor am I a man...so I don't really care to play a male toon.Seventh was C, the little girls looks interesting.  However, her gun is massive and again - she's a small girl.Final choice was G, because it's a very old man and no one really cares to play as an old man.  The wizard aspect was interesting, but not enough to move it up the rankings."
892,Female,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,25-34,,,"I prefer less realistic more adorable characters. Big head little bodies, super cute."
893,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,I like the options that look more human like.  I tend to not like the fake looking characters though they are popular in society so maybe I'm in the minority.
894,Male,$0-30k,Black,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,The art style in Option F is imposing yet sexy
895,Male,$0-30k,White,High School,45-54,,,I like the look of more traditional cartoon styles that don't over exaggerate features on the characters.
896,Male,$0-30k,White,High School,25-34,,,"I like cartoon realism so the character type of C with the short look but cool design is appealing to me, I least like the look of a frozen like character of choice E"
897,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,,,"I prefer most of the choices because the body proportions seem more realistic or more appealing overall because they are not extremely out of the ordinary. Character size is not as important as the overall cohesion of the characters limbs, torso, head etc."
898,Female,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,21-24,,,"I would want to see option E. That character reminds me of Anna from ""Frozen."" She's a pretty design with soft features. I also like her hair. It's very unique."
899,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,"I prefer the cartoony-yet-realistic look of E. It's balanced and very stylish. People love the movie that featured that art style as well, so it would be nostalgic."
900,Male,$0-30k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,"I have seen so many games with C, D and A's style that it's hard to get exited about them visually. Option B is really unique and interesting as far as design, making me curious about it more."
901,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,,,"I chose option B, I don't like mobile apps that are too cartoony and I think the wizard looks quite dynamic.  It would meet my fantasy needs much better than the other four."
902,Male,$31-60k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,I would go with option E because it looks the most original and enticing to me. Option B and A look quite fun too. Option D and C look less desirable to me overall.
903,Male,$0-30k,White,High School,35-44,,,I prefer the more detailed animation with more lines and more fine edges and such.  Much more for the eyes to feast on
904,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,"Here are some examples of different mobile game art styles. Which styles do you prefer? Please explain why in detail.- I prefer C the most here because it's simplified and smoothed out but also original and fun. It's not taking itself too seriously or overly violent looking, it's an art style that would appeal to both kids or adults - like something you would see in a Pixar movie."
905,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,"D seems most friendly and fun, B and E most adventuresome. C is ugly in design, A is ugly in style."
906,Male,$61-100k,Black,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,I like option D the best because I like how the characters feature have been exaggerated to make him look more cartoonish.
907,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,"This design makes the character look threatening, strong, believable and makes me want to take it seriously."
908,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,,,"I prefer the option B game wizard character design because this design is the most detailed and makes this wizard look powerful, strong and intelligent. I chose option E second because the artwork is realistic than most of the other options and the color scheme more clearly highlights the shadows and grim look on the soldier's face. I chose option D third because the uniform of this soldier looks more like a cartoon but still has enough detail to be interesting. I chose option C fourth because this troll has poorly textured skin and clothing and its face looks rather unrealistic. I chose option A last because this soldier has no eyes and not much of a facial expression, which makes this character look less interesting than the other options because of the lack of realistic detail in this character design."
909,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,C is a good balance of effort without trying too hard. E and b are trying too hard while d and a aren__ trying hard enough
910,Male,$0-30k,Hispanic,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,"E has a pleasing style to it that looks the best, and is very pleasing to look at."
911,Male,$0-30k,Hispanic,Vocational Training,25-34,,,I prefer the detailed hand drawn look.
912,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,"I'm someone who likes details in my designs, as that shows great animated art style in my opinion based on my own personal preference. Option E is my top choice because it's the most detailed, while still appealing to people of all ages. Option C is last because it's just too childish and over the top for me."
913,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,"Option E has great details of the player, I can see all the creases in the armor and in the weapons and clothes. Option D is fine as well. It's a simple design, but there is still good detail. Option B feels kinda boxy to me.  Option C looks like a 3rd grader drew it, and Option A, I like to see some eyes on the cop, and it looks way to simple."
914,Male,$101k+,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,,,I ranked my choices based on which seemed placed in a fantasy setting.
915,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,Choice B is the best-looking avatar of the 4
916,Male,$0-30k,White,High School,25-34,,,"The characters are all well made, I made my choices based on which speak to my own beliefs so far as what interests me"
917,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,B looks Designed Very Well And Interesting / E looks Impressive Good /C looks Good /D looks Good/ A looks Good
918,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,"Options E and B look the best to me because they look real and modern. Option D looks good because the details of the character are quite realistic. To me, option A and C both do not look good and seem childish."
919,Male,$31-60k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,"I like option E/B because it looks polished, stylish, and mature. It makes for a more serious type game and feel."
920,Male,$61-100k,White,High School,45-54,,,"I prefer choices E, D & C as my favorites, the character in choice C is very masculine, but very appropriate for a medieval type game...he has a very good amount of detail. I really like the ones in choice D & C, I don't know if I would actually play these character, but the attention to detail in their likenesses is fantastic."
921,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,,,Each have good attributes but I like the tough guy in panel E the best.
922,Male,$0-30k,White,High School,25-34,,,"I prefer the more detailed looks such as options E and B, because I find they tell me more about the characters and give a better opportunity for artists to do designs they feel good about. Of course, the more simple computer generated modeling style is easier to create and work with, and also has its merits."
923,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,Option B has a very gritty yet unique style that makes me want to learn more about the game and the world that it takes place in.
924,Male,$61-100k,Hispanic,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,B and E look the coolest
925,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,25-34,,,I love option E the most because this style of artwork best brings out the vibe of the character as well as being more detailed.
926,Male,$31-60k,Black,Graduate Degree,25-34,,,"Option E would be my best image as it closely resonates with an amazing game art style. The image is a presentation of an amazing imaginary game in production and therefore my preference for the image would be in the order I have selected E, B, D, C and finally A"
927,Male,$0-30k,Other,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,B and E have the most realistic art style with a fantasy focus. D uses a military focus with cartoony characters. A does too but even more cartoony. C has a real cartoony orc.
928,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,"1. E. Colorful, but still realistic humanoid character.  Simple and classic.2. B. A little darker and more monochromatic than I would like, but still a nice realistic human feel to the character.3. D. Has a very Toy Story animated feel, but still tries to make the character look human with facial features.4. A. Human character, but no real attention to detail, and very generic feel.5. C. Don't dig the blocky generic monster look."
929,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,i prefer the art style in option B the most because it has a fantasy feel but retains a human feel too
930,Male,$31-60k,Asian,Graduate Degree,25-34,,,"I choose E because the design of the character is visually attractive and creative as well, compared to other options"
931,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,45-54,,,Enjoying a game is an incentive so I feel the storyline in E and B would be the most interesting and enjoyable.
932,Male,$101k+,Black,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,I would choose choice E first because it looks more real and it looks like a soldier and it makes one to desire to play the game with confidence then choice B will be next because it has a good style of posing and the the colors of the persona is good and it gives one a good confidence to play the game then choice D and CV will be next which really do not bring out the real threat and the feeling of fighting from them and it does not create any form of threat or confidence to the game player and last choice A which really is not attractive and even from the look one does not really get the motivation to play the game.
933,Male,$31-60k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,,,"I like the simple design of my top choice, which is fun and exciting. Very cool for sure!"
934,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,45-54,,,The art styles are well articulated to suit the game.
935,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,"First, C, D and A look more for children.  B and E are more adult themed.  B is my favorite because not only does he look cool, he looks like a powerful wizard."
936,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,I like the first two choices. The others are a little more cartoonish. The first two look cool and would be fun to play that kind of character
937,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,"Between these, options B and E really captivate me more. They have both realism and exaggerated features, and the characters seem more relatable and less fantastical. Options D, A, and C all seem generic and childish, and that doesn't appeal to me as much."
938,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,,,I don't want the silly cartoony looking ones.
939,Male,$61-100k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,I liked choice B since the art style is highly detailed and the character looks strong and confident. Choice A looks more plain and over simplified which doesn't look eye catching.
940,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,25-34,,,"I liked the more detailed and passionate art style used in E and to some extent B.  Otherwise, I thought D was the best of the more cartoon like styles."
941,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,25-34,,,"I like that option D is the most realistic with the most details in the costume and face. I do not like the simplicity of option A, it just looks crappy."
942,Male,$101k+,White,Graduate Degree,25-34,,,"I really like option D the most but I think it's because I'm a fan of the gun but I also like the style because it's not too much or too little detail.  I like option A the next most, it doesn't have alot of detail in the character but it seems like a fun game I can just pick up and put down and just have a good time with.  Next I chose option C the guy looks hilarious, should be a fun game but not quite as good as option D or A.  Next I chose option E, I think it's cool and looks nice but it looks to be set in the medevial times but I really don't want to be sword fighting in a game. Lastly I chose option B, it looks like a wizard and the game probably involves alot of thinking, when I play games and watch things I do so to unwind not to do additional thinking about something that was meant to be fun."
943,Male,$101k+,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,"I feel like this heavily depends on what genre of game. I like B and E because I like playing RPGs or some rpg-action based games on mobile and these fit that criteria. They're more for gritty and more realistic games. However, I do like some simplistic games where the design is more along the lines of D. Games like Castle Clash where D and to some extend A stands out. Less realistic than B and E but easy to discern most things. And cartoony violence. Not sure where C is from but not fond of it."
944,Male,$61-100k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,I actually prefer the more silly and childish looking characters in a game. The first 3 options remind me of the characters in team fortress 2.
945,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,"Options E and B, in that order, are my preferred styles for a mobile game because their costumes and bearing and attitude convey an image of strong character and ability."
946,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,I like unique but easy to comprehend art styles are best when trying to grab the attention of gamers.
947,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,,,I think the cartoonish art style is a better fit for mobile games and one i am accustomed to.
948,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,,,I prefer a more realistic art style in the games that I play because it adds to the immersion and helps me to feel like I'm inside the game. I like that this also has a bit or artistic flare while still being realistic.
949,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,"The main distinction for why I ranked the options as I did has to do with level of detail and complexity. Option B looks like it's the most detailed option with respect to specific details that make the art look more interesting. I like option B the most because of the way the costume is designed, the book, the seriousness of the look and demeanor of the character and the overall presentation. Option B also has details that make it unique and memorable, like eyes, eyebrows, a nose, a beard, and a mouth. The mouth in particular allows for option B to have a serious facial expression which conveys more seriousness the overall presentation. Those details makes the overall art style more interesting to look at and create better contrast for the color scheme and the perspective. Option E is my second favorite option for similar reasons. The art style is almost as detailed as option B. Option E has armor, and facial expressions. Also there's eyes, eyebrows, a nose, a mouth, and a seriousness to the look and demeanor of the character. I also like the consistency of option E with respect to the color scheme and the contrast of the colors presented. Aesthetically option B is the most pleasant to look out because the art style is consistent but option E is almost as pleasant because of the consistency with respect to design of the costume and the overall complexity of the design. I like option D third best because it is detailed but also somewhat generic. There is nothing very unique or interesting to distinguish the character of option D. Where option B has the significant beard, and option E has the long hair and the grim demeanor, option D looks somewhat boring by comparison. While option D does have a greater level of detail that makes it an option I rank higher than options C and A, it's not as unique or memorable compared to options B and E. So I like the art style I just don't like it as much as the options I ranked higher. The color scheme is also somewhat bland and doesn't contrast as well, and there's not as much of a range of colors compared to options B and E. I like option C fourth best because the design is very simple with respect to the presentation. The character doesn't have a nose. The color scheme is very minimal. There is a limited amount of facial expression and the single eye limits how much seriousness can be conveyed especially with respect to the absence of eyebrows. So in terms of art style I don't think option C is as distinct or memorable compared to options D, E, and B and so that's why I ranked it my fourth favorite option. It does have some detail that makes it a higher rank than option A, and that's with respect to the complexity of the posture and overall demeanor of the character. I just don't like the minimal art style as much and so it's not something I prefer. I like option A the least for a variety of reasons. The character, in the way that the character is presented, doesn't appear to have eyes, ears, or eyebrows. That makes the character very minimal with respect to facial expression or the expression of really any kind of emotion at all. The mostly blank face distinguished only by a nose and a thin line for the mouth just isn't as detailed or complex compared to the much more detailed options especially for B, E, and D and so that's something that I don't prefer with respect to the art style, because it is just too minimal and simple for my preference of what an effective art style looks like. Option A also has a very limited color scheme so there's less contrast, and it's not as aesthetically pleasant to look at compared to some of the other options. The overall simplicity of the art style for option A is not my preference and so that's why I ranked it last. I like the more complex art styles more because they afford a greater level of detail and expression and so that's why I ranked Options B and E as my two most favorite options because they have the greatest level of detail and complexity."
950,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,"The pictures below are from a tower defense mobile game, which style do you prefer? Please explain why in detail.- This is a cool character - like a magical wizard that is ready to cast spells and defend my town with his pet bird! C & B look the most complete, and A looks unfinished."
951,Male,$101k+,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,,,I ranked my choices based on which character looked the most realistic/life-like.
952,Male,$0-30k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,"Option A is just more fun and endearing, especially with the character having an animal companion. It's a more fun to look at design compared to the others."
953,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,,,"I prefer the option C tower defense mobile game character design because this design is the most detailed and makes this wizard look powerful, strong and intelligent. I chose option B second because this character design is too block-like and rigid and looks shorter in stature than the option C wizard. I chose option A last because this character design is too small and the hands are not detailed enough to show the wizard holding his book clearly like in the other character image options."
954,Male,$0-30k,White,High School,25-34,,,I think the design in C is the best looking one. I don't like B much because the character's eyes are crazy. I don't like the pose or how short the character is in A.
955,Male,$0-30k,White,High School,35-44,,,I like it when he looks noble yet still aggressive and capable like my first choice
956,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,,,Option C is the only one that looks good out of these three choices.  I think option B and A look too cartoony for my liking.
957,Male,$101k+,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,,,I prefer option C because it makes him look the most powerful and strongest.
958,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,B is the right mix of comical and lifelike. C and A are too much on their respective sides
959,Male,$31-60k,White,Graduate Degree,45-54,,,"I like Option B best because the style is more distinct, less fuzzy than the other two options. This is a character I can relate to; the other two, not so much."
960,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,"The stance, look, details and overall mood makes him look more mysterious and almost up  to no good (in a good way) for me."
961,Male,$0-30k,Hispanic,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,"I feel that B looks the best, and meshes well with what the character is about."
962,Male,$61-100k,Black,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,I like option C the best because I like how the character is drawn in a style that resembles how a character would look like in a comic book.
963,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,"C, seems a bit more serious and the art is less comical than my other choices.B, This one is ok, but doesn't seem like he's all there or serious in the face.A, This poor little guy is just tiny and hilarious."
964,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,The more abstract the geometry gets the more it looks like concept art rather than a finished piece.
965,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,Option C is the best blend of being realistic yet also detailed.
966,Male,$0-30k,Hispanic,Vocational Training,25-34,,,"I think option C should have Option A's bird, and he would be perfect"
967,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,"Option C is the cleanest of the three. I can see the detail of the character quite well. Option A is boxier in comparison to C. And I do not know what's u[ with Option B, put the color tones and shades are just awful. Now shadows and just wrong shades of each color."
968,Male,$0-30k,White,High School,25-34,,,"All the characters are cool but I made my choices based on which character looks the ""friendliest"", bonus please"
969,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,C Looks Interesting And Meaningful /A Looks Interesting/B Looks Interesting
970,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,"I think the wizard looks better with the staff in his right hand and the book in his left. He looks like a true wizard and you can get a full view of his character from this angle. I feel like the angle on C is off by comparison. A isn't bad either because it's pretty unique and I appreciate the more cartoonish aspect with his short stature and the bird on his staff. I just feel like the image feels a bit squished, too. B is classic and effective."
971,Male,$31-60k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,I like option C because it looks the most polished. The other options looks a little too cartoonish.
972,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,,,I like the character in panel A.  His magic touch to lift the book in mid air and have a balance of the wooden beam.
973,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,"Option C has a unique artistic style that I have never quite seen before and I find very interesting, so that is the one I would choose."
974,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,I like option A the best because it looks the most believable. I like option C because it looks intense and cool. I do not like option A because it looks too cartoonish and not believable.
975,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,25-34,,,I love option C the most because this version of the character looks the most aggressive making this character the best for this game.
976,Male,$61-100k,Hispanic,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,C looks cooler
977,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,The character in Option C appears very fierce and powerful and it has the best design style here.
978,Male,$31-60k,Black,Graduate Degree,25-34,,,Option B is the most preferred as it looks more realistic compared with the other images and would definitely be more appealing for an upcoming game image as it would easily attract new users
979,Male,$0-30k,Other,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,C looks pretty badass. B and A go for more of a cartoony look. It really depends on what kind of vibe the game is going for.
980,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,"1. C. The character has the most human looking features and body proportions, and even though it is a fantasy game, it is nice to have plausible and relatable characters.2. B: The character looks human, but his eyes are drawn in an overly large comic style that makes it slightly harder to take him seriously.3. The dwarf shaped character and the cartoon bird on his staff make the art feel like a Disney movie rather than a fantasy game, and I'm not into that."
981,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,i prefer the style in option C because the colors and clothing give it an adventurous feel
982,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,45-54,,,The style in C is just designed better and looks like a real being.
983,Male,$31-60k,Asian,Graduate Degree,25-34,,,I choose C because the design in C makes character looks powerful while still maintains its uniqueness
984,Male,$0-30k,White,High School,25-34,,,"The character in C looks the coolest and most heroic to me. The design is the sleekest and most realistic, while still having a clear fantasy vibe. A is sort of on the other end of the spectrum, more cartoonish and with a fun gnomish looking character. My problem with B is that it's sort of in between and to me has less clear of an identity and less character."
985,Male,$101k+,Black,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,I would choose choice C first because it has the most attractive features and it also has a good colors to it making it really nice to look at then choice B will be next because it has some good design and the pose of the persona is good though the features are not as detailed as the ones in C then lastly it will be choice A which has no good color first and also the features of the persona are not that well defined.
986,Male,$31-60k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,,,"The wizard looks fun and inquisitive in my top choice, which is appealing. Very cool design for sure!"
987,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,45-54,,,the images are very attractive and  i would like to try this game
988,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,"Even though the bird is small, I think it makes a little wizard stand out more. It's the little things that steal the show"
989,Male,$101k+,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,,,I think A is a bit goofy with the bird and the person being so short. C is too dark. So I chose B first.
990,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,"Option C has just the right mixture of fantastical and realistic, and the character looks much more exciting and interesting to me. I prefer it by a large margin to the more expected cartoon nature of options B and A."
991,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,,,The other two look less serious and more funny.
992,Male,$61-100k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,I liked choice C since the character looks confident and serious which is most appealing. Choice A looks too short and timid which isn't too confident and looks weak.
993,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,Option A features a shorter character but the set is very creative with the bird providing lookout
994,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,25-34,,,"I liked C most because the style comes across as serious, and I'd image the artwork for the game as detailed and full of passion.  I thought B was also okay, but A looked awkward to me."
995,Male,$61-100k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,They are all very good. Option B is plain and simple. All characters should follow the same design otherwise the game may come off as too much.
996,Male,$101k+,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,"For a tower defense game, I feel the need to be able to clearly identify the character is important so A is my choice. It has less harsh shadows hiding details and feels like I can easily see this wizard tower anywhere on the field. The simpler style makes it look distinct compared to the other two. B and C are good and I would expect to see them on maybe a selection screen than on the field. I feel B is better than C as it's a bit more cartoonish and less realistic. I expect the more realistic one to be for an rpg."
997,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,"I like option A the most because it has a bird. I think the bird makes the option unique and the style different. The bird looks like it is a familiar of the wizard. I also think the art style is unique and distinct, and that it is very memorable with respect to being an art style that I think would work for a tower defense game. The character's floating book in particular really conveys a sort of magical power that the other two options are not as effective at communicating and so I like option A because it looks the coolest, it has the bird, and it has the floating book. All of those details are consistent with the theme of a tower being defended by magic, and the overall theme of a tower defense game. I like option C second best because the art style is nice. The option is aesthetically pleasant to look at with respect to the design of the costume because the color scheme has very good contrast. In particular the way the cape flows and looks like it has helped to defend the character is a subtle detail that makes option C slightly better than option B. I think option C is good but option A is more unique and distinct. Option C has nice details that make it better than option B though, especially with respect to the leaves giving better contrast, the cape looks like it is affected by wind, and the character has a more serious and determined look. I like option B the least because it's not as unique or memorable compared to the other two options. This is for a variety of reasons. First is that the cape looks brand new and like it has never been worn, which doesn't really convey that the character is a defender of a tower for a tower defense game. The shoes also look odd like they don't quite fit the feet of the character. Option A and C the shoes look like they fit the character's feet but option B the shoes look uneven. The character also doesn't look as serious for option B with the smile compared to the serious faces of the character for options C and A. So I like option B the least because I like options A and C better for the various reasons listed above."
998,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,I prefer the style shown in Option B because the character looks strong and determined and capable and would be a good character in such a game.
999,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,I feel like serious faces are more apocopate for an action video game.
1000,Male,$0-30k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,Option D is still expressive while being stylish and not having the cell shaded look most of the other designs have that cheapens them.
1001,Male,$0-30k,White,High School,35-44,,,I like the options A and B are more realistic.
1002,Male,$31-60k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,"I prefer option A because the style looks the most cute and fun. Option D, C, and B look pretty great to me as well. Option E looks decent but does not feel quite as favorable to me."
1003,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,,,"I chose option B, it is the only one I really care for out of this lot in regards to a video game.  It is the only image that feels complete, the rest feel like rough ideas."
1004,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,"E is the most unique one in my eyes. It's cartoony, I think, and I prefer animation over the more realistic graphics most games have. I like the style on display with this image. It looks more professional, like more effort has gone into it and it isn't generic like most mobile games feel. A has a nice cel-shaded look and I like the more unique colors on it. The darker tones look pretty great. After that, D has another unique, sort of cartoony look, and I think it's quite distinct and solid too. B is similar to A but worse, and C is generic and sort of off in the face."
1005,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,"The pictures below are from a tower defense mobile game, which style do you prefer? Please explain why in detail.- B & A are the clear winners here - they're the most ""finished"" looking and I love the details on the character like his water jug and belt. So cool. The other images look unfinished and uninteresting."
1006,Male,$101k+,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,,,I ranked my choices based on which character looked most realistic/life-like.
1007,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,,,"I prefer the option A character design because the artwork is more realistic than all the others and the color scheme more clearly highlights the shadows and grim look on the soldier's face. I chose options B, D and E second, third and fourth because option B has a more smooth surface texture that is not as realistic, option D looks too small in comparison to the other but still has a very realistic facial expression and option E and misaligned shadows and a texture that makes it difficult to discern the details of the soldier's clothing and facial expression. I chose option C last because this character design has several poorly drawn shadows, a non-existent facial expression, poor eye color and looks in bad shape overall."
1008,Male,$61-100k,Black,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,I like option D the best because I like that the character has a cartoonish look about him.
1009,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,"This design makes the character look much more threatening, tough, and with better weaponry"
1010,Male,$0-30k,White,High School,35-44,,,I enjoy a realistic look that has been adapted to animation very well and stylized in a unique way.  My first choice fits that bill quite a bit.  Stylizing realism is what really makes a game stick with me.
1011,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,"I feel like the scratchy style of C and E won't display well on a small screen, detail will be lost."
1012,Male,$101k+,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,,,I prefer option A because the graphics and shading make it the most realistic looking of all the choices.
1013,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,"I prefer a more realistic and imposing style, as that makes it seem like the stakes are higher. That's why A is my top choice. Option D because it's too over the top."
1014,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,B is a good balance of drawn and real life detail. It__ looks the best in my opinion. A is decent as well but looks more detailed. The others I__ pass
1015,Male,$0-30k,Hispanic,Vocational Training,25-34,,,"This one is cool because of the aggressive shading, and the eyes hold the most emotion."
1016,Male,$0-30k,White,High School,25-34,,,I like the characters done in the more simplistic style of animation the best
1017,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,E designed And Look Is Very Beautiful Finish/A Looks Interesting/ B Looks Interesting /C Looks Interesting/D Looks Interesting
1018,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,Are the best looking characters and the ones I like the most.
1019,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,"Option A is my favorite because the character looks real and believable. I like options C and B next because they both look good with minor issues. Option D looks strange to me, but option E is much worse as it turns the character into too much of a cartoon."
1020,Male,$61-100k,White,High School,45-54,,,"I really only prefer choice B out of the styles shown here, with choice C as a distant second. the character in choice B has the right amount of detail, realistic looking but fantastic at the same time."
1021,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,,,I like the character in panel B.  His is big and strong and have good weaponry.
1022,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,I like that the characters face has an almost undead quality to it. It makes me feel like the game has a dark undertone to it which I would really enjoy.
1023,Male,$61-100k,Hispanic,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,A looks more realistic
1024,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,,,E because it looks like it has the most character depth and because he looks like a warrior.
1025,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,25-34,,,I love option E the most because this character has the biggest muscles as well as looking the most badass and being the most exciting to play with.
1026,Male,$31-60k,Black,Graduate Degree,25-34,,,The difference in some of the images are very negligible but I would prefer option A as it looks more realistic and appealing compared with all the other images and also in the order I have selected from the most preferred to the less
1027,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,"My top choice is the character in image B and A. But Especially 'B' because he appears very bold and strong, not like the others with the thin legs, this one looks more like a fighter and someone that conquers."
1028,Male,$0-30k,Other,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,A and B have a more realistic art style. C has realistic proportions but not so much with the style. D and E messes with the human proportions.
1029,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,i prefer the style in option B the most because the character retains the human feel while still being fantasy
1030,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,"1. A. Colorful palette, realistic facial features, outfit, and proportions, nice clean and realistic character rendition.2. B. Same realistic vibe as A, which I dig, though the smoothed out textures of the rendering look a little off.3. E. Has a vintage animated feel but still attempts to give the character realistic features, proportions, and expressions.4. C. Cool realistically styled drawing, but the blacked out eyes ruin it and make it look weird.5. D. The proportions of the character's body ruin it.  Having the giant spear and tiny fighter makes it hard to take seriously."
1031,Male,$31-60k,Asian,Graduate Degree,25-34,,,I prefer A over other options because the character in A looks more appealing and eye-catching than the rest
1032,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,45-54,,,"The styles in A, B, and C looks like a true warrior and read for whatever may come their way. I like A better because it's clean and more visually appealing."
1033,Male,$101k+,Black,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,I would choose choice B first because it is more defined and the soldier almost looks real and it can give one the confidence of playing the game then choice A and E will be next because I find them well defined and they are posing in a way that creates a sort of confidence and desire for one to game with them because from the look they really look masters at the game then the last choices will be C and D because they actually not that well visible and even the faces are not as defined as the ones of the past choices and also the body sizes are not that convincing to game players to create a sense of confidence that they will win the battle.
1034,Male,$31-60k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,,,"I like the simple design of my top choice, which is fun and exciting. Very cool for sure!"
1035,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,"I like option B the best because it is cartoony but also real looking at the same time and is a good ""in-between"" of those two that fits right, in my opinion."
1036,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,The character in E looks the strongest and most muscular.  He looks like he would be the best one to defend something.
1037,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,45-54,,,The character is a beautiful fit for the game.
1038,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,It reminds me of the cartoons of when I was very young. Kind of like that. Robin Hood Fox cartoon. Just is distinct and I remember it and I liked it
1039,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,"Option E looks cartoonish, but it really stands out as visually impressive and much more interesting to look at than the other choices. Options B and D are nice, but they don't have the same visual panache as option E. Options C and A look kind of boring in comparison."
1040,Male,$101k+,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,,,I like the more realistic characters best. A fits in this category the most. C is a close second but has less detail. B is a bit too flat and D looks kind of silly with the giant weapon. E last because it is dark.
1041,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,,,For me these are mostly about shading.  Some are too flat while others have shadows that are too heavy.
1042,Male,$61-100k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,I liked choice A since thecharacter looks highly detailed and more time and effort was put in to the design. Choice D looks too simplistic and not as eye catching.
1043,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,,,C has a very down and depressing look. Both D and E look kind of silly. A cut-off sword does not seem to fit this good looking character from B. The shadows from A seem to buy a little goodwill on the cut off sword.
1044,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,Option C has nice lines. Option D is too small. Option E is visually unappealing.
1045,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,25-34,,,"I thought A looked realistic and had a nice gritty and motivated look.  I also thought B was decent, though the character showed less desperation. I didn't like that E and D felt overly cartoonish."
1046,Male,$101k+,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,"B and A are definitely my favorites. The styles are bright, colorful and clean which I like. It makes them stand out a bit more to me than the others, which is great for a tower defense game (so you can easily see your side). I like that the shadowing isn't too harsh like it is in E and to a lesser extent in C (loss of some details in the darker areas). D is fine but seems a bit plainer than the other two and feels very generic."
1047,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,25-34,,,"I love the attention to detail in option A. You can make out the facial expression and every fold in the clothes is shown, it is impressive."
1048,Male,$61-100k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,The skinnier almost stick figure like drawings feel like it would make the game more funny and relaxing. It adds a fun twist to the game. U chose my option based on less detail of the characters. In tower defense games you will focus on the swarm of enemies and not your character
1049,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,,,I like the oversized caricature of E
1050,Male,$0-30k,White,High School,35-44,,,I really like the water and I think my first choice is a happy medium between the two designs
1051,Male,$101k+,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,,,I ranked my choices based on which island had the most detail and the best variety of terrain to interact with.
1052,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,"C doesn't seem to have a natural color for the water, A is by far the most detailed"
1053,Male,$61-100k,White,High School,45-54,,,"I like the overall graphic to the look of the island in choice B the most, even the the graphic isn't quite as well defined as it is in choice A. The island in choice B has a lot of rock formation which would definitely help to create and/or maintain a fortress or defense areas."
1054,Male,$0-30k,White,High School,25-34,,,The island in A looks larger and more fun than the islands in B and C. I chose B over C because the colors in C are very dull and unappealing.
1055,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,This terrain simply feels more difficult to defend and wage offensive against due to how uniquely versatile and staggered it all is. It would make the better game and overall fight.
1056,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,25-34,,,I really like option C because it feels old school but also real at the same time. It feels retro but also like something that could exist in the real world and in the virtual world which is cool!
1057,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,35-44,,,"I like how vibrant this one is, the style reminds me a bit of SNES RPGs, something like Chrono Trigger, really nice landscape."
1058,Male,$0-30k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,"The brighter colors of Option B and A really make the graphics pop and are more interesting. Option A, however, is too visually noisy thanks to the geometrical shapes, making Option B my top choice."
1059,Male,$0-30k,White,Associate Degree,25-34,,,I like the harder lines and contrast on C but A  looks more detailed.
1060,Male,$61-100k,Other,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,"My first choice, I selected because I could easily see the details and levels of the terrain. On a small screen, this is very important for strategy games. My second choice had some details for the level of terrain, and the third choice had very little detail within the animation."
1061,Male,$31-60k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,I like option B because it looks the most explorative and creative. Option A and C look decent but does not really compel me as much overall.
1062,Male,$0-30k,White,High School,35-44,,,I like that option A seems to have more visual detail.
1063,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,,,"I voted for option A, out of the three images it is the one that looks the most complete.  Reminds me of an old Sega game."
1064,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,"This is a tower defense mobile game, which of the following styles do you prefer? Please explain why in detail.- Image A is so colorful and bright, how can I not pick it!? It is full of energy and detail compared to the other two and looks much more interesting."
1065,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,"Option A is my favorite because of the level of detail that it has PLUS the vibrant colors, such as the vivid blue. C is too muted."
1066,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,,,"I prefer the option A tower defense mobile game style because I like the more detailed structures and how the triangle shapes provide more texture and sense of depth to this game scene. I chose option B second because I like how the teal color water is clearly distinguishable from the grass land in this game scene. I those option C last because this tower defense mobile game scene uses a mild green water color that is very difficult to distinguish from the grass land, especially the island in the lower right corner of this image and the trees along the top of the larger island."
1067,Male,$61-100k,Black,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,I like option A the best because I like way the island is full of trees and has greenery.  I also like the little river flowing out of the top of the island and I like the water surrounding the island.
1068,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,A looks the most like water Surrounding the land. B looks a little like water. C looks nothing like water to me
1069,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,"A is the most beautiful, adventuresome and inviting. C seems a little scratchy and unfinished."
1070,Male,$0-30k,Hispanic,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,C has a unique style to it that draws my interest to it the most.
1071,Male,$0-30k,Hispanic,Vocational Training,25-34,,,"I like the hand drawn look of this map, it seems authentic, unlike the others."
1072,Male,$0-30k,White,High School,25-34,,,I like all of them but the more simply designed style looks the best to me
1073,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,A looks Very Beautiful And Impressive Look/ C Looks Good/B Looks Interesting
1074,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,Choice A is the best looking
1075,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,,,I like panel A.   I think the graphics are a little more clear and yet more detailed.
1076,Male,$0-30k,White,High School,25-34,,,"I find option B has a good blend of both stylized features (heavy shadows, bright colors) and detailed features - without either being too overpowering. Option C was my initial choice until I realized that the heavy shading and dark outlines which I so enjoyed may become difficult to read text or messages that are layered above it."
1077,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,"I prefer the more cartoonish style of option A, it looks more happy and bright."
1078,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,As a civ player my eyes go right to seeing thr little pieces that might be ocean and it seems so familiar
1079,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,I like option A the best because it looks the most detailed and realistic. Option C is the middle best option. I like option B the least because it looks odd without grass on the island.
1080,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,,,I like C the most but the unrealistic way the water flows down from the rock and the color of the water overall made me veer to A. In a I love the way the water flows to the bottom pool.
1081,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,25-34,,,I love option A the most because the island is surrounded by blue water making it the most attractive and aesthetically pleasing.
1082,Male,$61-100k,Hispanic,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,C is more appealing
1083,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,"The picture in Option A appears more lively and engaging., especially because of the entire color scheme."
1084,Male,$31-60k,Black,Graduate Degree,25-34,,,"The colour in option A makes it look real and much more appealing compared with the other two that are less colourfull. My preference in terms of order would be option A, then B and lastly is option C from the most to the least preferred"
1085,Male,$0-30k,Other,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,A looks really cool. B is like A with some minor differences. They remind me of Pokémon's art style. C is cel shaded which is cool. Reminds me of Okami or Legend of Zelda Wind Waker.
1086,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,"1. A: Most diverse color palette, crisp outlines of trees and buildings, nice textured terrain.2. B: A bit bland in terms of features like trees, needs more outline and shading, but still not bad.3. C. Just feels incomplete because of the minimal amount of colors used, particularly the way the water looks gray and almost whiteish rather than a crisp blue."
1087,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,i prefer the style in option B because it has pleasant colors and a fantasy feel to it
1088,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,45-54,,,I like the fact that the tower is surrounded by water but not totally. It would be hard for infiltrators to get into.
1089,Male,$31-60k,Asian,Graduate Degree,25-34,,,"I choose B because the design of B is extremely unique and visually attractive, compared to C and A"
1090,Male,$101k+,Black,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,"I would choose A first because of how first the image has been created, it is the most natural of all the three images in the sense that you can be able to see that the walls are in the middle of the sea and also you can see the several amenities in the wall where you see the house and other things then choice B will be next because it also has a better view of the walls is good looking and you can see the environment is more natural then the last choice will be C which has the least favorite environmental look and it does really match out a good mobile game view."
1091,Male,$31-60k,White,Graduate Degree,25-34,,,I like the more realistic imagery presented. It makes it feel like it's a real location that I could really travel to and experience. It just makes me feel like I'm really doing something rather than just having an arbitrary virtual experience.
1092,Male,$31-60k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,,,"I like the bright water and detailed land items in my top choice, which make a very cool design for sure!"
1093,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,45-54,,,the tower picture says a lot about the game.
1094,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,I like the blue our water in the picture. I think it looks more like it's supposed to be an island
1095,Male,$101k+,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,,,I like the realism in A. B looks a bit too cartooney.
1096,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,"The semi-realism of options C and B really seems visually exciting and bold to me, and for that reason I am much more inclined to choose them. Option C in particular seems natural and earthy. Option A isn't nearly as appealing in my opinion."
1097,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,,,"B has a great balance of realism and abstraction, and looks balanced and pretty."
1098,Male,$61-100k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,I liked choice A since the image is highly detailed and grabs my interest right away. Choice C looks too simplified which isn't eye catching and not as appealing to play.
1099,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,25-34,,,I like that option A looks the most realistic and complex. It looks like it has the most opportunities to change your defense strategy with the multi tiered area.
1100,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,ranked the product based on the quality of clothes  and attractiveness of the clothes
1101,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,This top choice has a body type that I think would resonate best as the most sexy with most people.
1102,Male,$0-30k,White,High School,25-34,,,"I picked the most attractive clothing in order, with D being the most appealing to me"
1103,Male,$61-100k,Black,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,I like option D the best because I like the stockings and the lingerie with fishnet parts.  I think that bests represents what a stripper would be like to try to entice her customers to tip more money.
1104,Male,$31-60k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,,,D- she seems to be very beautiful and good looking B- she seems to be nice and attractive C- she seems to be wearing a attractive and unique color and outfit A- She looks colorful and simple which is very appealing
1105,Male,$0-30k,Black,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,The other choices look way too photoshopped.
1106,Male,$101k+,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,,,I ranked my choices based on which face I found the most appealing.
1107,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,,,I prefer the option D character design because the outfit is less revealing and and posture is more impressive and curvy. I chose option C second because this character is wearing a nice black outfit but it is rather revealing. I chose option A third because this character is more skinnier and athletic looking than the more plump option B character design.
1108,Male,$0-30k,White,High School,35-44,,,"I'm a sucker for pantyhose and lingerie.  I think the face of my second choice should be on my first choice, that would be best"
1109,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,45-54,,,"The gang theme face and storyline is so exclusive to the game, this is a game i would like to try out."
1110,Male,$31-60k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,I like option A because I think she is the most elegant and stylish. Option B and D are quite impressive too. Option C is my least favorite overall!
1111,Male,$0-30k,Hispanic,Vocational Training,25-34,,,This one looks the youngest and most realistic.
1112,Male,$31-60k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,I love the outfit of option A. It's minimal and accentuates the model well. Red is also a classical sexy  lingerie color.
1113,Male,$101k+,Black,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,I would go with choice A first because of the tattoo at the lower belly and also the outfit is looking good and last the pose of the person is attractive then the next choice will be C where I love the pose of the lady and the tattoo on the one hand then the outfit is looking nice then the next choice will be D because of the pose of the person but the outfit is not that great then the last choice will be B which the lady has too much covering for a stripper.
1114,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,35-44,,,"A looks trashy with the specific tattoos.  B's outfit is hot and would be my favorite,  C is also very attractive."
1115,Male,$31-60k,Asian,Graduate Degree,25-34,,,Option B was my first choice because I liked the fishnets and the red color of the outfit made it stand out more in an appealing way. Option D was my second choice because I liked the garters and thigh-high stockings of that outfit. Option C was my third choice because that outfit was somewhat plain but the fishnets did look good. Option A was my last choice because I didn't like how there wasn't any legwear in that outfit and it looked rather sleazy overall.
1116,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,25-34,,,I love option C the most because of her sexy black outfit as well as the tattoos on her arm making her even more attractive.
1117,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,45-54,,,"Everything about the stripper in option D is tempting. The outfit, the pose, the lipstick as well as the smile. I love the red outfit on stripper A and the location of the tattoos."
1118,Male,$0-30k,Other,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,These all work. C and D are the more attractive ones compared to B and A I feel. But not too much so.
1119,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,The one in Option D looks mostly attractive and sexy because of her outfit and attitude.
1120,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,"I like the overall style and pose of C; love the hair style. Not a fan of the outfits in A or B... especially not B. But, I went with A over D because I really don't like the hair style or sternum tattoo in D. Then B comes in last because of the outfit (D's outfit is best out of all of them)"
1121,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,I love the outfit.  The thigh highs do it for me
1122,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,,,"D looks burned out and worn out. A looks pretty realistic but I like to imagine strippers as younger and sexier looking. B is a pretty realistic idea of what I would see in a strip club, but I would prefer if she was wearing black. C looks nice and fits well with the explanation."
1123,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,"i like the stripper in option C the most because she looks like a ""real"" girl with her black colors and fishnets"
1124,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,"Option A shows the most skin due to her lingerie being the most revealing and not wearing stockings. She has a pretty face. Option C looks good in black, has a pretty face, has nice curves on her hips, and is fit. I think option B is the prettiest but her abdomen is flabby. Option D is not appealing because her face is ugly."
1125,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,35-44,,,I ranked them off of the outfit and hair. I also ranked them based on how I felt personally attracted to them.
1126,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,I choose the answer D because this is  very attractive and sexually
1127,Male,$0-30k,Hispanic,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,"I feel that B has the look that best reflects the description of the character, and fits the best."
1128,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,She looks the most trashy. Which fits the stripper mentality. I noticed her immediately
1129,Male,$31-60k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,,,"I like the pink and red color scheme of my top choice, which is sultry and seductive. Very cool for sure!"
1130,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,,,"I like option C, I think the character is extremely attractive.  I'm not too much a fan of fishnets and tattoos, but I think her hair and face are gorgeous.  I think if she had the outfit of option D, it would be a perfect image."
1131,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,,,The face and the body shape of choice A and C are what makes me attracted to them.
1132,Male,$101k+,White,High School,25-34,,,"I think B is the most attractive. I like the outfit, hair and general appearance more than the other options. I think the amount of tattoos is just right without being 'too much'."
1133,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,"It's the tattoo.  It's an arrow that makes your eyes go that direction, and your mind wander"
1134,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,25-34,,,I think Option A is the most attractive. I like her tattoos.
1135,Male,$31-60k,Black,Associate Degree,25-34,,,The dress code is well themed for the job
1136,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,,,"Definitely D.  The way she's standing with her hand on her hip, her hair and her expression are very attractive."
1137,Male,$0-30k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,"The hair styles in Option C and B really make the person look younger and more attractive. The body in Option C also looks younger and in shape, making her more attractive and look like she actually in shape enough to be an exotic dancer or stripper. ."
1138,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,"While I certainly do not think my wife would appreciate me looking at these, naturally being a male, any of these choices would do great as the lady looks wonderful in all of them. I had to pick one first, and I do really like the fishnet and black bra/panties combo with Option C."
1139,Male,$61-100k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,I liked choice A since the character looks the most attractive and their outfit is the most sheer and barely there. Choice D looks more plain and generic and look like they came from the 80s which isn't appealing.
1140,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,,,"None of these are attractive, and they're all very similar, but A seems the most realistic."
1141,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,Option C is my choice because she is the hottest looking of the four options and the fish net stockings provide an interesting look.  This is a young woman who is a survivor and will do whatever it takes to survive in this game.
1142,Male,$31-60k,White,Graduate Degree,25-34,,,I think option A is the best because the outfit feels the most attractive and I think the tattoos seem to really add to her attractiveness. I feel if I were to go to a strip club she would be the one I would tip the most and want to see the most. I also like the color of her outfit.
1143,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,A looks Beautiful Impressive And Sexy /D Looks Beautiful /C looks Impressive /B looks  good
1144,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,"The outfit and the general design of option D makes it the best choice, followed by option C. These seem to fit the story best and grab my attention the most. Options A and B look far more generic and unexciting to me, and I would be hesitant to choose either of those."
1145,Male,$61-100k,Asian,Graduate Degree,25-34,,,"I prefer Options B, C, and A the most, especially B and C. Options B and C have the right hairstyles and facial features to match a very attractive stripper, as well as fishnet stockings that emphasize their legs. Option A works as well, though her look feels a little dated. I think that Option A would work a little better with a more modern hairstyle and also stockings of some kind."
1146,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,I think the options with fewer tattoos looks better and are more attractive.
1147,Male,$0-30k,White,High School,25-34,,,"B, I find the overall outfit very attractive, the short skirt really catches my eye, and the noise piercing and facial expression are attractive. I also find the heart tattoo and long straight hair very appealing.C, the skin tone is very attractive with a slight tan, I find the tattoos are extremely appealing, and the belly piercing and bra color look very alluring.A, I find the eye shade color, and facial expression, along with hair look very attractive. However I dislike the red clothing color, it makes me much less interested. I do find the tattoos look appealing.D, I really like the clothing fishnet, it catches my eye and attracts me, however there is too much skin covered that it makes me less attracted. I still find the facial expression alluring however."
1148,Male,$61-100k,Asian,Graduate Degree,35-44,,,All of the depictions here are great. I like option D the most for fitting the description. The all black seems cool here and love that look. The hair is great too. I like option C and the fishnet is nice. Option B in red has a good sultry look to her. Option A is cute and love the idea with the tattoos. Each of them have a great design and outfit.
1149,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,45-54,,,I prefer the stockings and specifically the style/color in B and D.  A's tattoos are unattractive.
1150,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,45-54,Action; Card; Music; Simulation; Sports,,"I think of it as we, the humans, are getting wiped out. I picture a foggy, very depressing image of not much life. There I picked the 2 that represented that first. The other two show zombies and one could argue that you would see lots of zombies as well, taking over.  I just think of something not in the city, no life, foggy, depressing... and if you are lucky enough to survive one might be hiding out in a house like that."
1151,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,35-44,Simulation; Puzzle; Card; Board; Adventure,,"The smokey scene, the destruction, and the run down look of the building all fit the premise of the backstory"
1152,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,25-34,Card; Role Playing; Simulation; Music; Strategy,,I like the realistic and run down look of Option A. I also like the idea of using a building as a base like that.
1153,Female,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,55-64,Card; Puzzle; Simulation; Trivia; Word,,"option A shows humans defending themselves and their shelter against a mob of zombies.  This fits the description in the question the best.  Option C shows humans fighting zombies but there doesn't seem to be a shelter they are protecting.  Option D has the zombies coming at them in a straight line which does not look like 'a wave of zombies'.  Option B has no activity, no humans or zombies."
1154,Female,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Card; Puzzle; Simulation; Word; Role Playing,,Option C is what I would imagine.  The abandoned cars and complete disarray are in keeping with what I think the world would be like.  With moving around alot there would be no order and image C makes this clear to me.
1155,Male,$61-100k,Asian,High School,25-34,Simulation; Card; Casino,,"though the human world is now messed up, the world itself shouldn't be depicted as misty and gloomy. i believe the world would move on without the humans and nature itself would look fine, happy almost. it's just the crumbling buildings and survivors fighting would be the only hint that ""the world is ending""."
1156,Female,$0-30k,Black,Associate Degree,25-34,Sports; Simulation; Puzzle,,"Options C and A fit my imagination for the description. For C, I like that I can see the zombies and people trying to kill them. Also, with C and A, the smoke/cloudiness helps to show the darkness of the situation and how bad it is (what the humans are going through with the zombies and trying to survive)."
1157,Female,$31-60k,Other,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Adventure; Puzzle; Card; Simulation; Trivia,,Scene A fits my imagination because it shows the action involved in the scenario. You see the humans safety retreat and the zombies encroaching upon it. I don't like B because it doesn't show any action for the scenario.
1158,Female,$0-30k,Other,High School,35-44,Card; Puzzle; Strategy; Word; Simulation,,"B and A definitely rank over C and D. I put B in first place because I like the idea of it being an abandoned grocery store. It makes the most sense for people to hole up in there, especially with the multiple floors for strategic and tactical reasons. I also prefer it to A because even though a gritter, more faded look makes a lot of sense for the aesthetics of a genre like this, there's something sadly poignant about the vestiges of bright, cheerful colors still trying to hang on. C ranks over D because D just looks too polished and cartoony, and I prefer the more gritty, grimy version in C."
1159,Female,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Strategy; Simulation; Card; Board; Arcade,,I like A the most because it encapsulates an eerie feeling and zombie apocalypse scenery.
1160,Female,$31-60k,Hispanic,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Arcade; Card; Family; Simulation; Word,,I prefer choice C because it is the one that represents zombies the most.
1161,Female,$31-60k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Card; Adventure; Role Playing; Simulation; Strategy,,i prefer lighter and brighter ones where it's easier to see what is happening. B and A look more realistic than C and D do
1162,Male,$0-30k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Action; Adventure; Role Playing; Simulation; Card,,Option A was my top choice because it has all of the best aspects of the other options. You have the building that everyone needs to survive in while having hoard of zombies surround it-- alongside realistic graphics.
1163,Female,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Card; Puzzle; Family; Simulation; Trivia,,A looks like a place that is being secured and defended from zombies.  C & D do have zombies attacking but I don't see the place they are defending.  B doesn't look like it is being attacked at all.
1164,Female,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Arcade; Card; Puzzle; Simulation; Word,,"C and A are the best; C has the open layout and gritty feel that I would associate with this genre and I think the world looks most fun to explore. A is pretty good too, the building could be a slight bit more run-down and condemned looking but it still has a ""post-apocalyptic"" feel. B and D aren't as good to me because things look too clean and bright for a zombie apocalypse; I'd expect something gritty and dirty (and bloody) like C."
1165,Non-binary,$0-30k,White,High School,25-34,Card; Music; Puzzle; Role Playing; Simulation,,"The exact spot in the timeline for a zombie apocalypse matters a lot to me, for humanity to have survived long enough to retreat ""again and again"" means they have to have built a successful shelter or two. I think the quiet dread between waves of attacks is the really interesting part about the setting, so I picked B ahead of A. C and D are mostly interchangeable to me but I like the foliage in C more."
1166,Female,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Puzzle; Word; Simulation; Card; Strategy,,"I chose C first, because it looks very rough and thrown together, with damage to vehicles and the enemy zombies shambling towards you, which is how I pictured the scene. I chose A next, because the makeshift look of the fortifications around the building and the decay fit well with the description. I chose D third, because while it is brighter and less gritty, the chaos of the scene and the random vehicles that the humans might use fits the world as described. I chose B last, because while the building looks suitably makeshift, it gives me less of a sense of the battle style."
1167,Non-binary,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Board; Card; Puzzle; Simulation; Strategy,,I like to feel isolated when I am playing survival games. It makes the game a lot more tense as well as enjoyable.
1168,Male,$31-60k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Adventure; Card; Role Playing; Simulation; Strategy,,D and C best fit my imagination for the scenario because it sounds like humans keep retreating and are constantly on the run so A and B feel too protected and easy to defend.
1169,Female,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,55-64,Card; Puzzle; Trivia; Word; Simulation,,"Choice A fits best with how I imagine it would look because it shows what I think is an established shelter being breached and attacked. My second choice shows the desolation that I imagine would be prevalent in such a situation. My third choice shows poles of dead bodies, which I think would clearly be part of the situation. My last choice doesn't seem to me to fit the situation very well since it doesn't really show any of the above listed details."
1170,Male,$0-30k,Asian,High School,25-34,Strategy; Sports; Simulation; Adventure; Card,,It shows them defending against zombies. Option C is the most accurate followed by A.
1171,Male,$61-100k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,21-24,Card; Strategy; Simulation; Adventure; Action,,"Option A is the best image that fits the topic since it shows a shelter as well as being overrun by zombies. The detail and fog in the image is also visually appealing, making the bleakness of the entire situation more obvious and draws the player in more. The other options are not good enough when it comes to detail when objectifying the topic."
1172,Female,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,45-54,Simulation; Word; Card; Adventure; Puzzle,,"I think A is the closest to what I imagine because I imagine trying to find a fortress or safehouse of some kind and the zombies trying to force their way in. That's also why I chose B next, even though there are no zombies in the scene, because it gives a sense of foreboding like the house is still, quiet, and just waiting for the inevitable hordes of zombies to discover it. C and D are lively and vivid, and I chose C over D because you can see the smoke all around, which makes it seem more real that there's shooting and/or explosions going on as the humans try to fight off the zombies. This seems closer to what might actually happen if the humans have time to arm themselves effectively."
1173,Male,$0-30k,White,High School,35-44,Trivia; Strategy; Simulation; Card,,"I ranked them in order of which ones seemed to closest fit the description of events.   A seems to show both the combat and fortification aspects of the scenario, which I think makes it the best choice.   B, my second choice seemed to best represent the idea of people finding shelter anywhere that they can and fortifying it against the zombie hordes, wile D & C focus mostly on the combat aspects of it with the sheltering aspects of it not really being a clear part of the setting."
1174,Female,$0-30k,White,High School,25-34,Arcade; Simulation; Trivia; Word; Card,,"I like that option D shows the carnage while the characters are trying to find shelter, I find that a realistic scenario. I like that option A shows the struggle of trying to keep the zombies out of a secured area, it's a thrilling scene in my opinion. The graphics with option C look a bit low end to me, it takes you out of the experience. I don't like that option B just shows an empty building, I find that boring."
1175,Female,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Card; Puzzle; Simulation; Strategy; Word,,"Option A in my mind just fits better. In my opinion it is the gloomiest of the scenes and represents the situation better. I chose the rest as if the one before it didn't exist. If the humans are forced to retreat into the shelters, we probably wouldn't see very many of them."
1176,Female,$101k+,White,High School,35-44,Simulation; Role Playing; Casino; Card; Adventure,,"A. According to scenario, it shows a shelter, that has a worn appearance, as it would during these times. The players are fighting a large horde of zombies that are trying to breakthrough the fence, which I seems to be a very realistic setting.D. While I feel the vehicles in this once seem a bit to be in too good of shape, I feel the way the zombies are presented, with dead ones on the ground and gory areas, is more realistic to the story setting, over C.C. The setting does show zombies and the players trying to kill them as the zombies approach them. I feel the actual physical setting of the location is a bit better than D, but D is slightly better as whole.B. This is my least favorite because it doesn't show any players or zombies, so it doesn't really connect to the scenario and storyline."
1177,Female,$61-100k,Black,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,Arcade; Card; Board; Simulation; Music,,I picked these based on the graphics
1178,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Card; Arcade; Puzzle; Word; Simulation,,"Option C is my first choice because I feel like it shows a battle between humans and zombies, which was the first thing I pictured in my head when I read this description. Option D is my second choice because it also represents a zombie invasion to me with a battle scene going on. It makes me want to know more. Option A isn't bad, but to me, it looks like things are ""over"" and in a slow period. That isn't as appealing when it comes to drawing in my attention. I ranked Option B last because it looks too calm and peaceful, like nothing is happening."
1179,Female,$31-60k,Other,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Strategy; Simulation; Puzzle; Card; Board,,I think that my last two choices are too colorful and happy looking given the dystopian description in the story.
1180,Male,$31-60k,White,Associate Degree,25-34,Action; Simulation; Card; Role Playing; Educational,,"Choice C does a nice job of illustrating the zombie outbreak without overwhelming the consumer. I like that it shows trees and a little bit of life to generate an image of hope still being possible. Choice A is a close second because it conveys a beautiful scenery that isn't too clustered and kind of gives a ""it's quiet....too quiet"" kind of vibe which is pretty creepy and hauntingly beautiful."
1181,Male,$31-60k,White,Associate Degree,25-34,Sports; Simulation; Card; Board; Arcade,,"Option A was my first choice because its a dark scene with a fortification, which is where I think people would be in this situation. Option C is my 2nd pick because, again, it is a dark scene and it seems like they might be out scavenging. Option B and D are too cartoon-y for me but I ranked them the same way I did options A and C in terms of where the people would be."
1182,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,35-44,Action; Card; Puzzle; Simulation; Strategy,,c and a look like a zombie attack.  the burnt out cars and trashed buildings look like it probably would in real life.  d has the dead people but the cars look brand new and not tore up.  b has nothing in it that has to do with zombies attacking.
1183,Female,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,Card; Strategy; Simulation; Puzzle; Music,,"I really liked option A  the best because from those television programs that show us what happens to our surroundings once humans either die off entirely or mostly.  With A, you can see it's been a bit of time, the danger is still there as there looks to be a horde of zombies at a gate.  I think it's realistic to see cars and trucks surrounding it, all betat up, burned out or what have you.  To me A is realistic.  I liked D as well because there was a pop of colors, you have the mass of dead, fresh zombies and dead fresh human bodies before they get turned.  You've got the taxi on its side and humans getting ready to lay into the zombies.  However, it doesn't feel as good as A robably becuase of the mass of blood and guts.  I think it would be more spread out.  C is my 3rd choce because it seems washed out, making (or would make) play a bit more difficult.  I do like how it's got the zombies coming in and you can see the humans at the ready with their firearms.  Yet, it's not my favorite 1st or 2nd because it's so washed out.  B made it in last because it just looks like an abandoned store in the middle of your trip up to the forest.  I see no humans, hurt humans, no zombies, nobody attacking, no dead anywhere.  I don't know what's happening with this one and yet it does NOT feel like zombies."
1184,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Card; Simulation,,I picked the ones with shelter first.
1185,Female,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Adventure; Role Playing; Simulation; Card; Word,,"a - the build up of bodies at the front - this is happening now more intense , c - seeing people from all angles shooting and the chain fence - shows people are trying to find saftley, d - lines of zombies chasing,and b- it looks like it is peaceful and hidden, maybe many years after zombies"
1186,Female,$0-30k,White,High School,25-34,Simulation; Strategy; Arcade; Card; Puzzle,,The colors in options B & D were a little too warm for a zombie game. It makes more sense to have the color scheme more gritty and cold. I always think the reality of a zombie uprising would be closer to C. You might be on the street and see a bunch coming towards you but you can still stand your ground for a bit before you need to run off since in my opinion zombies wouldn't be super human they'd be kind of dullards. Option A was a close second to this because of the color and it's probably a scene where you might be hiding away somewhere. The only issue with that one is I think I see a giant which is unlikely since there are no giants in life but suspended belief is fine. Option B doesn't show much of anything and is too color warm.
1187,Male,$101k+,Hispanic,Graduate Degree,45-54,Card; Puzzle; Simulation; Strategy; Word,,"Given the amount of time that everyone has spent at home in the last two years, my mind first goes to the types of shelters that the non-zombies would create, not straightaway to the zombies themselves. I like the images with human strongholds best. The images with the streams of zombies also look good, but they make me think of standard tower-defense games rather than new and different games."
1188,Male,$101k+,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Card; Puzzle; Role Playing; Strategy; Simulation,,"The picture clearly needs to show zombies and some sort of fortifications, preferably in action. Thus I chose option A first.  The least fitting was B because it doesn't show any zombies.  D was next to last because it doesn't really depict fortifications/a shelter.  D was good but should show a little bit more of the shelter.  If it did, I'd have chosen that one."
1189,Female,$0-30k,White,High School,21-24,Music; Card; Simulation; Adventure; Casino,,"I like C because it fits the story better due to the fact that it says humans retreat again and again, so it has been going on for a while meaning it would be impossible for the place to look so good like in B. I do like the version of B that has moss on the building that also looks kinda neat so it was  a hard choice honestly. D kinda looks like a Call of Duty map though too so I am not sure about that being my second choice compare"
1190,Female,$0-30k,White,High School,18-20,Sports; Simulation; Board; Card; Casino,,"I ranked these from most to least realistic. A couple of these looked almost ""uncanny"" or unrealistic to the situation."
1191,Male,$31-60k,Black,High School,35-44,Adventure; Strategy; Simulation; Card,,C is the most clear on what the game seems to be about.  A gives a good theme but isn't as clear.  D's blood seems overdone for some reason.  B is just a building.
1192,Male,$61-100k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Strategy; Role Playing,,I liked choice A since the theme of the game fits the description the best with the zombies and stronghold. Choice D looks too different and not as eye catching and relatable with the theme.
1193,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Role Playing; Strategy,,I prefer the option A scene design because I really like the concept of the zombie horde trying to get in the building like in several classic zombie movies and the giant zombie looks cool and exciting to see. I chose option B second because this building scene is much less dynamic with much less fortification along the walls of the building than shown in the option A game scene design. I chose option C third because I think the hero characters would not pile up zombies in large piles like shown in the option D game image nor try to fight in hand to hand combat like shown in the option D image if there is an easy escape route and the people are not cornered like in the option C image.
1194,Female,$0-30k,White,Less than High School Diploma,35-44,Strategy; Action; Role Playing; Simulation,,There is mist presented here.  It helps with set the ominous atmosphere. The horde is necessary to illustrate the zombie threat.
1195,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Arcade; Strategy; Trivia; Role Playing; Simulation,,"The smokiness of the first three options make them the top choices over Option D. However, Option A is my top choice because it has the best combination of a smokey environment and a detailed environment."
1196,Male,$101k+,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Word; Strategy; Role Playing; Adventure; Action,,"A definitely fits my imagination the best. It's a group of people defending what base they could establish and call haven. and the zombies are attacking to take that away from them. I imagine the rudimentary defenses like wooden walls that people can make trying their best to shore up whatever defense they can. D and C is similar and reminds me of people perhaps traveling or running away from the zombie horde after being ambushed or their previous home taken. They do their best to mow down the zombies and use whatever obstacles, like cars, they can as leverage. B looks too pristine for a zombie apocalypse."
1197,Male,$31-60k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Strategy; Action; Adventure; Arcade; Role Playing,,"The blood in my top choice is scary and compelling, which is appealing. Very cool design for sure!"
1198,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,25-34,Card; Role Playing; Simulation; Music; Strategy,,Option A fits my imagination because I imagine a zombie apocalypse would be run down and dangerous looking like what it shows.
1199,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,Family; Puzzle; Action; Role Playing; Strategy,,"B makes little sense to me, I see no Zombies here. C looks like a hopeless struggle with zombies all around. A is a really neat image but it seems impossible given todays technology. D most closely aligns with what I imagine given the description at the outset."
1200,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Adventure; Strategy; Role Playing,,"They're all a very similar style, but I like B the best because I like the juxtaposition of disrepair and disarray with the bright colors ."
1201,Male,$0-30k,White,Less than High School Diploma,35-44,Card; Role Playing; Adventure; Strategy; Arcade,,I like the looks of A as it looks like a proper zombie holdout in this type of game and the scenario of them being able to defend the base seems more plausible with A.
1202,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Adventure; Card; Role Playing; Strategy,,"i just imagine being out and having the zombies coming forward, trying to funnel them inside any way i could"
1203,Male,$31-60k,Hispanic,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Adventure; Role Playing; Strategy,,"C,with it's abandoned cars make it seem as if people fled in the midst of a disaster, making it fit more in line with what i would assume to happen during a zombie apocalypse."
1204,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,35-44,Card; Adventure; Strategy; Role Playing; Simulation,,Option A gives me the most zombie take over vibes.  It looks like these people seriously need my help to stop the invasion!  There is a sense of urgency in the photo that I like.  C is similar to A but does not seem as urgent as there are less zombies.  B just really is bland and doesn't do anything to sell the scenario where as D I just dislike the art style a lot.
1205,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Adventure; Arcade; Puzzle; Role Playing; Strategy,,A and D show the most zombies and I think they are the best fit for the presented narrative of the world being overran with zombies
1206,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Adventure; Role Playing; Strategy,,I like b off a start up screen.  Shows without the zombies and you can watch them move in.
1207,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Strategy; Role Playing; Simulation; Action; Adventure,,"The massive amount of zombies, displayed approaching the building, really puts you more into the scene"
1208,Non-binary,$0-30k,Other,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Adventure; Action; Strategy; Role Playing; Educational,,"D looks most realistic. It looks like a scene full of common objects/structures, and based on the description it hasn__ been long enough for stuff to fall into disrepair. C also looks fairly realistic although I think the level of disrepair appears a bit too much for the story given. With the remaining two, the fog makes it look weird and not realistic, and also the heavy fog effect makes it look like some kind of fantasy game not a zombie setting"
1209,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,Strategy; Simulation; Role Playing,,"The level of social decay and destruction seems to be appropriate in this image. The streets are overgrown. The cars look long abandoned. I like that there is a little bit of fog, but not too much like some of the other images have."
1210,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,Action; Simulation; Sports; Strategy; Role Playing,,"Option C was the best in my opinion because I really liked the broken down cars and overall damaged look.  It really tied to the scenario as I felt cars would be among the first things that would be obsolete.  Option A was my next choice as I really liked the overall destructive look.  It was very close to my top choice, but it didn't pop out the dame was as Option C.  I selected Option B third because I felt the shelter was a bit too nice looking considering the scenario, but I thought the fog was a nice touch.  Option D was my last choice because I thought the vehicles were too nice and looked like they were still operational."
1211,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Board; Simulation; Strategy; Puzzle; Role Playing,,"The thick fog in A and B makes me think of mystery, which the plot of the game evokes, so I think those two fit the most"

1213,Female,$31-60k,Black,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Adventure; Board; Strategy; Role Playing,,The scene that fits my imagination is Option B. I like the realistic look over the cartoon version of the scenes. Both Option B and A can work for me as the final setting look.
1214,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Role Playing; Strategy; Puzzle,,A looks like they are desperately trying to hold off the horde which is what you think of when you think zombies
1215,Male,$31-60k,White,Graduate Degree,55-64,Adventure; Action; Strategy; Puzzle; Role Playing,,I like the more realistic scene of this one. It makes it seem more scarier.
1216,Male,$31-60k,White,Graduate Degree,25-34,Casino; Arcade; Strategy; Role Playing; Sports,,"Option A has a clean, yet grungy look, that pulls off an incredible vibe.  It is simplistic to see why this would be considered a phenomenal option."
1217,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Adventure; Card; Role Playing; Strategy; Action,,"C evokes the most familiar imagery to me. It has everything, the gates, the zombies, the broken cars, the guns. D is very similar though not gritty enough in my opinion. Stuff looks too clean. A has the best art style, though the turret base defense stuff looks weird. B looks way too cozy to me. Like it just doesn't feel gritty and I wouldn't even know zombies were involved just looking at it."
1218,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,35-44,Action; Adventure; Role Playing; Simulation; Strategy,,"A and C are my favorites, the are darker and and feel scarier also love the fog, the other 2 options come off as too ""bright and clean"" to me and ruins the atmosphere"

1220,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,35-44,Adventure; Simulation; Strategy; Trivia; Role Playing,,"I like how C and D are action shots that shoe zombies in hoards, I would go with one of those"
1221,Female,$31-60k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Role Playing; Strategy,,"If I were truly in a zombie-like scenario, I would most likely be in option B.  We live in the middle of nowhere, have fencing, and are secluded from the outside.  Hence, option B was first because it's a solo house with fencing.  Option A is my second choice, because again it's a single house - however, I don't agree with the hoard of zombies outside of the gate.  We would never let it get that bad.  Option C is my third choice, because again we live in the middle of nowhere - it is highly unlikely I would be killing zombies across a parking lot.  Option D was my last choice, because of the parking lot and because the white bus an yellow car look absolutely brand new.  Nothing here looks like that."
1222,Male,$0-30k,Black,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Role Playing; Strategy,,Option C better encapsulates the chaos and horror of an zombie infested world
1223,Male,$101k+,White,Graduate Degree,25-34,Card; Role Playing; Strategy; Sports; Casino,,"Given the scenario, the first thing that comes to my mind is the image presented for Option A. I would think that have a dedicated and barricaded shelter would definitely play a part in this situation, and also knowing that it would come under attack by zombies is what made me think more vividly of what is represented in option A compared to option B, which was also a consideration."
1224,Female,$0-30k,White,High School,21-24,Role Playing; Strategy; Simulation; Adventure; Action,,"Option A is better because whenever I think of zombie apocalypses they are in a supermarket or somewhere you know there's food and water and other supplies. Option B looks great but the setting in a forest looks a bit weird. Option D is nice, I like the way they gathered to kill the zombies, but I don't think that a setting in a parking lot is something you would look for in a zombie apocalypse therefore option C is my last because they are not even gathered strategically."
1225,Male,$0-30k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Action; Adventure; Role Playing; Strategy; Educational,,I like the scene in option A the best. The visual style looks the most realistic and evokes a sense of struggle compared to the other scenes.
1226,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Adventure; Strategy; Role Playing; Simulation,,A look super real and lots of zombies attacking. C is not bad either it has nice real look to it. D and B look to playful and cartoonish for me.
1227,Male,$0-30k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Role Playing; Strategy,,Options C and D of not a typical fortress or headquarters once has to protect makes it more full of surprises.
1228,Female,$31-60k,White,High School,55-64,Strategy; Word; Trivia; Puzzle; Role Playing,,This one is more of a zombie attach vibe than the others. Hiding in a shelter and all of the zombies trying to get into the place.

1231,Male,$31-60k,Asian,Graduate Degree,25-34,Trivia; Strategy; Simulation; Role Playing; Action,,"I choose A because the scene looks chaotic, dramatized and intrigued people to figure out what's happened, compared to other options"
1232,Non-binary,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Role Playing; Puzzle; Card; Strategy,,"D is a bit too bright for something gritty. C and A fit best for the tone, I think, but I think they may need adjusting depending on how long the world has been overrun. If it was overrun for a year or something, I was wondering why things would be so deteriorated and overgrown already. If it's been overrun for a decade, it makes more sense that stuff would fall into that amount of disrepair."
1233,Male,$0-30k,White,High School,35-44,Puzzle; Role Playing; Strategy; Sports; Simulation,,"This would be my choice order but A, would be my #1 pick as it fits better as a shelter with hordes of zombies at the gates, and guard towers and snipers to fight the zombies off"
1234,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Sports; Adventure; Strategy; Role Playing,,"A is my first choice because everything looks more dismal, rugged, lived-in, and desperate given the hordes at the gate. B is similar to A but I prefer how A models desperation better given the zombies outside the gates. C is an appropriate, but typical scene for a world overrun by zombies, however I do not find anything inspired or unique about it given it's just random cars and boring structures. D is my least favorite because it looks far too pristine given the shading and buildings for a world on the brink of destruction."
1235,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Strategy; Trivia; Word; Role Playing; Puzzle,,Option A looks the most fun to me. I like the idea of having to defend a small area from an invading zombie horde. D would be my next choice because I like the colors and the gore. C would be third because I like the graphics and the burned our cars. B is last because I don__ see any zombies in it.
1236,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Adventure; Casino; Strategy; Action; Role Playing,,This scene is what I imagine with the given scenario. It makes more sense to me if an apocalypse were to occur that this would be a stage we'd be in. It's also more intriguing and more appealing.
1237,Female,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,Adventure; Role Playing; Arcade; Strategy; Puzzle,,"You've got to show the zombie horde, so C is best followed by D. A looks nice and destroyed. B is too pretty for a zombie apocalypse."
1238,Female,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,Card; Role Playing; Adventure; Arcade; Strategy,,Option A looks secluded and damaged from possible explosions or other rioting.
1239,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Action; Adventure; Role Playing; Strategy; Simulation,,the graphics on this one look the most realistic and easy to see and bright. the others look too cartoony or game-like
1240,Female,$31-60k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Card; Adventure; Role Playing; Simulation; Strategy,,B is the most fun and appealing looking scenery. i prefer lighter and brighter ones where it's easier to see what is happening. B and A look more realistic than C and D do.

1244,Female,$31-60k,White,High School,55-64,Puzzle; Trivia; Word; Music,,"Option C is my first love here. It's a little smoky but not too horrible. Reminds me of my favorite show in the scene, the Walking Dead. It is so much like a scene from there. Its clear and precise. You can see lots of characters. Option D is almost as good, but it lacks some depth and realism to it. Otherwise not horrible as far as real looking. You see blood splatters and stuff which is what you would want on a scene that gory. Option A is a little too smoky and foggy. You can't really see many characters there. If you do it is not that clear, the is a distance to the characters perhaps that makes it all seem bland and blank. Option B is last because this is just a house. Nothing else but smoke surrounding it. I would want to see people or zombies in it, but it is empty that way."

C also looks a bit more disorganized and abandoned to me than D which better reflects the world I would expect.  But D is my second choice because it is so vibrant and obvious what is happening.  A is next followed by B, but I think both have too much mist and it's too hard to see what is going on."

It shows more despair than ""D"" does."
1254,Female,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Trivia; Word; Educational; Puzzle; Strategy,,I prefer option A because this image scene looks much more fitting due to being surrounded by fog and colors used for everything translate that vibe which was described in the given scenario.

Next was option B because it has a ""less is more"" type of mystery to it. Options C and D definitely get the point across as well, but options A and B are much more ominous feeling."
1270,Male,$101k+,White,Graduate Degree,55-64,Puzzle; Trivia; Word,,Answer A has smoke/fog and mystery as well as the hordes of Zombies. Answer C has the same as A but clearer and less organized. Answer B has no visible zombies and fits less well than all others.
1271,Female,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Word; Card; Trivia; Strategy; Puzzle,,"Human beings do not seem to act rationally when presented with chaos and disorder, so option D, which has a lot of dead bodies, is my first choice. Option B is too calm and collected, and does not fit what I see when I think of this scene."
1272,Female,$0-30k,White,High School,55-64,Puzzle; Trivia; Word; Music; Strategy,,Seems the most realistic.   Like that it is a little smoky as it adds to the eeriness but not too much that it obscures the scene.
1273,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,25-34,Trivia; Puzzle; Action; Strategy; Word,,"C has the best blend of realistic/good tone, without being obscured by e.g. thick fog. I do actually want to be able to see it."
1274,Female,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,55-64,Trivia; Word; Puzzle,,Really only C fits my imagination with its sparseness.  D is a bit too clear and clean.  A is too foggy which seems unnecessary.  B looks too nice and is unrealistic.
1275,Female,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Arcade; Card; Puzzle; Word; Trivia,,I think everything would look rundown and worn. I think a little bit of the smoke is realistic. I think the smoke in options A and B is too dense.  I think everything is too brightly colored in option D.
1276,Female,$101k+,White,Graduate Degree,45-54,Board; Trivia; Word; Card; Puzzle,,"To me the hordes of zombies is what I think of when thinking of the text.  The movies, tv shoes and video games I have played reminds of the first three with the hordes of zombies' attacking. The last one just looks like an abandoned house."
1277,Female,$101k+,White,Graduate Degree,45-54,Family; Puzzle; Trivia; Word,,I feel like choice A best represents what a shelter would look like in this scenario.
1278,Female,$31-60k,White,Graduate Degree,55-64,Adventure; Card; Puzzle; Trivia; Word,,C fits my imagination best.  It shows people partially protected behind a fence with defenders clearing the gathering zombies.  B is somewhat similar but looks like it was early on in the zombie war. B looks like a before scene.  Whereas A looks like it's well into the war and is much close to what I'd imagine.
1279,Female,$101k+,White,High School,55-64,Family; Trivia; Card; Puzzle; Word,,I think B looks more like a village for zombies. at least from what I have in my mind one would look like.  really between the others I'm not sure which one I would say.. they are all different but those dont say zombie to me.
1280,Female,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,65+,Puzzle; Card; Trivia; Word,,I see lines or groups of people.  I see the typical pose with their arms straight out and white bandages all over.  I see guards and guns.  Zombies also mean fog or mist or minimal light.  Spookiness.  Possible organ music.
1281,Female,$31-60k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Word; Trivia; Strategy; Puzzle; Card,,Scene C has very little but abandoned vehicles and people fighting which is what I would assume there would be little in the way of buildings because damage and burning because we have seen that in real life from rioting
1282,Female,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,65+,Puzzle; Trivia; Card; Word,,Zombies!  I am not really a fan of zombie dramas but I picked D because the conflict between zombies and humans is clearly depicted.
1283,Female,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,65+,Word; Sports; Card; Puzzle; Trivia,,"These first two seem more plausible - ordinary life but with a twist. The other two almost look like a place you might want to visit. I think the idea of everyday life suddenly falling apart is scarier than a fantasy world that goes wrong. And it wouldn't take long for things to deteriorate to C, because once people stop looking after things, they fall apart rapidly.  But all of these images work, really. I can see good things about them all."
1284,Male,$101k+,White,Graduate Degree,45-54,Casino; Racing; Word; Puzzle; Trivia,,"The wide-open urban spaces, like parking lots, seem like fitting grounds for a grim contest of humans and zombies. The options I ranked 3-4 don't seem sufficiently urban to capture my interest."
1285,Female,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,65+,Puzzle; Trivia; Word,,"The scene should show zombies and destruction, death. Option C strikes me as the most somber with the ""cloudy"" edges around the image and a large number of zombies. I like option A next because it shows the structure and the fencing but it is not clear to me those are zombies."
1286,Female,$61-100k,Black,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Word; Trivia; Simulation; Puzzle; Family,,"A shows the devastation and the people trying to protect their shelter from the zombies.  C is the same but not as dramatic you can't see the shelter they are trying to protect. D looks like they are just people killing zombies.  B doesn't tell a story, it could be about anything."
1287,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Puzzle; Educational; Card; Trivia; Word,,"Scene C fits my imagination because it looks realistic and frightening. I think it has the right combination of looking like the real world, but also being having a creepy aura."
1288,Female,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,25-34,Card; Educational; Puzzle; Word; Trivia,,I think C and D look the most realistic plus sort of apocalyptic and chaotic not like they're out of a kids movie or something
1289,Female,$0-30k,White,High School,35-44,Music; Word; Trivia; Card; Puzzle,,Options C and A look the most like I would expect the place to look if there are zombie attacks happening constantly.  Option D is last because it looks much too normal and calm.
1290,Female,$101k+,White,High School,55-64,Board; Educational; Puzzle; Trivia; Word,,In this sort of scenario I see people moving to higher locations like roofs.  I can see there being bodies and mess in the streets and people fixing up roofs as living spaces and for use as guard towers.
1291,Female,$0-30k,White,Less than High School Diploma,65+,Puzzle; Music; Trivia; Board; Word,,Both C and D depict remote type locations with many people driving all sorts of vehicles.  Option A is too overdone in my opinion and option B is far too nice looking for the described scenario.
1292,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,55-64,Arcade; Family; Puzzle; Trivia; Word,,I like this scene the best if mankind is retreating it seems they should no longer be in the city. This looks like a hideout in the country side
1293,Female,$31-60k,White,Graduate Degree,25-34,Puzzle; Racing; Board; Trivia; Word,,Seems most to reflect what it would seem like in modern times and with zombies.
1294,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Puzzle; Card; Word; Trivia,,"I imagined hordes of zombies trying to break into shelters, and people fighting them off from inside the shelters. Option A does a good job of showing zombies at the gate. The playable characters are too exposed in option D, and the zombies seem like they're just queuing up to die."
1295,Female,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Board; Strategy; Trivia; Puzzle; Word,,"A- The structure looks fortified and there are people behind the fence fighting  back. There are a few building in close proximity used as a strongholdC- Also seems the humans are organized and fighting backD Although humans are fighting back, they are in open territory and it doesnt seem controlledC-Not a lot going on here, doesnt seem like there is a defense strategy nor imminent danger"
1296,Female,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Puzzle; Arcade; Casino; Word; Trivia,,"I chose A as my first choice, because it is most like what I imagine a zombie apocalypse would be.  It has a fortified house with zombies trying to get in.  I ranked the rest in descending order of what I imagine it would be like."
1297,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,65+,Puzzle; Trivia; Arcade; Card; Word,,"A and C illustrate a desperate situation where the zombies have completely upset the applecart. The humans up to this point are losing.

1298,Female,$31-60k,White,Associate Degree,45-54,Card; Puzzle; Word; Trivia,,"I like how option A looks like the end of times. Everything looks like it is falling apart. I also like the looks of option C. It looks like a lot of action and looks real.  Option B looks mysterious and suspenseful. I like it, but I prefer the more realistic looks of A and C. Option D looks like a low quality game. I would be interested in it if I saw this screen shot."
1299,Female,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,Puzzle; Trivia; Sports; Word,,I feel that the first two I picked are the only ones that truly show the idea.  The other two are not true representation of a zombie attack to me.
1300,Female,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Adventure; Music; Trivia; Word; Puzzle,,C is my first choice cause it gives me the picture of zombies over taking a place that looks destroyed and abandoned.   Option D is a close second giving me the same picture of what the description says.   A and B tie for third and both don't give me the picture of zombies taking over.  It just looks like a deserted place.
1301,Female,$61-100k,White,Associate Degree,25-34,Action; Strategy; Trivia; Puzzle; Word,,"I chose option A first because it looked closest to mounding waves of zombie attacks. If I imagined __eeking shelter_ and locking down this image was the closest to the description of what it said in the beginning. Option C was second only because it lacked the visual of sheltering in place but still have the aesthetic of a zombie war. This image to me is more if they are out seeking supplies or food. It didn__ embody the description the same way as the first image.Option D for me similarly was like C it still has the aesthetic of a zombie takeover. I could see this again as a fighting scene or a transition scene. However it didn__ embody and complete the whole description as the first image did. Option B was last because although it__ the same building as in A just before the takeover, this to me is like a flash back image. It shows before it really gets bad or like what they chose at the beginning as shelter. It doesn__ give off that they are in the middle of battling zombies or there__ been an encroachment on human existence."
1302,Female,$101k+,White,Graduate Degree,65+,Board; Card; Puzzle; Trivia; Word,,I like the busy-ness of these.  There seem to be a lot of people running around doing things - that keeps my attention and makes me more curious.
1303,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,Puzzle; Strategy; Trivia; Board; Word,,"Option C, because it shows people running for safety, they're trying to escape the zombies. Option A also shows destruction, but not as much. Option D, shows people walking around, they don't look very scared of anything. Option B doesn't look like anything bad has happened."
1304,Female,$0-30k,White,High School,35-44,Puzzle; Word; Trivia; Card; Board,,"I chose A because it does look pretty void of everything, which is how I'd imagine it to be. I chose C next because it chose all the destruction, but also the zombies as well. I didn't imagine them to be that plentiful, but did image there must be some visible. I chose B next because there is a part of me that imagines some things left a bit ""untouched."" I chose D last because it just looks too ""populous."" There's too many people, and too much going on to make the scenario believable to me."
1305,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Trivia; Word; Arcade; Puzzle; Music,,"Option A is the best; it looks more ""apocalyptic"" . Option C is pretty gory which goes well with the zombie theme. Although ""D"" might be a better fit, the desolation of option B seems more on brand for humans hiding for their lives."
1306,Female,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Puzzle; Role Playing; Trivia; Word,,A because of the dark cloud and it shows the different sides.  C was the next best because it shows the struggle between the humans and zombies. D just didn't look as desparate.

1308,Female,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Arcade; Puzzle; Role Playing; Word; Trivia,,"Option D looks way too clean and happy for the zombie horror genre. D and C both look too cartoony. Option A looks really eerie with civilization falling back to nature, but it's still beautiful to look at."
1309,Female,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Trivia; Word; Educational; Puzzle; Casino,,Based on the 4 images. A fits my imagination. I see A being what it would l9ok like then secondly C. I can see A turning into C.
1310,Female,$101k+,White,Graduate Degree,45-54,Puzzle; Trivia; Word; Educational,,"In a zombie apocalypse, a base would be needed so the building seems better than a parking lot. I would expect it to look overgrown and tatty like option A. Option D seems the least likely since the vehicles look new and who is building vehicles during an apocalypse? Option C looks decrepit like I expect but where is the base? Option B looks good as a base but who had time to keep the paint so fresh during a zombie apocalypse?"
1311,Female,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Puzzle; Educational; Trivia; Word,,I chose choice C because I liked the apocalypse vibe. It just exudes chaos to me.
1312,Female,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Simulation; Trivia; Word; Family; Puzzle,,I chose the option that looks the most upsetting yet also realistic.
1313,Female,$0-30k,Black,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Trivia; Word; Card; Family; Puzzle,,Option C looks the most realistic and next is A. They both have a look they have a gloomy look and options D and B looks pretty clear!
1314,Female,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,65+,Board; Card; Puzzle; Trivia; Word,,I chose A first because the compound looks as if it does a good job of protecting the humans inside and the humans can fight off the zombies with some protection. I chose B next because the compound provides good protection for the humans but the zombies aren't shown as attacking the compound. C and D don't seem to have a very strong compound and there is nothing to protect the humans who are out of the compound fighting the zombies.
1315,Female,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Puzzle; Adventure; Casino; Trivia; Word,,"I picked A as my top choice because I picture the humans building a house and the zombies coming after them.  This picture goes perfect with the description and what I imagine.  I then picked C as it also does a good job of capturing what I imagine-zombies going after the people.  I then picked D as it does not go with the description as well.  I picked B lastly, because it just shows a house and does not show the zombies taking over.  In fact, it shows no zombies."
1316,Female,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,Puzzle; Trivia; Word,,"A and B seem to have created a fort sort of affair, a central building with defensable walls around it.  That's what is needed, IMO"
1317,Male,$61-100k,Black,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Adventure; Puzzle; Card; Word; Trivia,,A looks like a dystopian zombie attack. B is similar to A but like the calm before the storm. C looks like a zombie wasteland. D looks like a cash grab.
1318,Female,$0-30k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Word; Trivia; Simulation; Puzzle; Arcade,,I picked C (and to a lesser extent D) because it'll probably be gory and chaotic. It was harder to tell with D what exactly was in the piles;  I'm guessing dead bodies? I thought A fit well with the chaotic part but B was too vague because nothing seemed to be happening.
1319,Female,$31-60k,Black,Bachelor's Degree,55-64,Strategy; Word; Arcade; Puzzle; Trivia,,"The way I ranked my options is based on the television shows that I have seen with Zombies in them. The Zombies come out of nowhere, the humans start to kill them and when it's over, there is nothing left but silence."
1320,Female,$0-30k,White,Graduate Degree,45-54,Card; Puzzle; Strategy; Trivia; Word,,"The scene that fits my imagination of a world which has changed dramatically because a large number of zombies that has encroached on human existence and the humans retreated again and again, gathering to establish multiple shelters and struggling against the waves of zombies is Choice D. Choice D shows a street full of carnage and destruction. There are bodies piled up and people and zombies fighting. It's probably the truest scenario out of all of the images. It's what a picture in my head when I think of a zombie apocalypse and what could happen, and especially how humans would react. Humans are stupid when it comes to pandemics and protests and war. They worsen every situation with emotions and cause chaos, and Option D's image is a perfect portrayal of that."
1321,Female,$31-60k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Card; Educational; Puzzle; Trivia; Word,,"All are nice, but only the first three show that the world is over run with zombies. D's colors are a bit too bright, but not every day in the apocalypse has to be gloomy, though readers/viewers will expect that."
1322,Female,$31-60k,White,High School,55-64,Strategy; Word; Trivia; Puzzle; Role Playing,,A because I would see it more this way. Hiding in a building and all of the zombies trying to get into the building. The zombies have the building surrounded So this one would be my pick
1323,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,25-34,Music; Puzzle; Card; Trivia; Word,,B seems odd because there are no zombies. C seems most realistic to me.
1324,Female,$61-100k,Black,High School,55-64,Trivia; Word; Racing; Puzzle; Music,,"Option A has more of the ""death and destruction"" feel with clouds rising from destroyed property. Option B is less cloudy but shows destroyed cars. Option C is cloudy but doesn't show anything destroyed. Looks more like a simply cloudy day. Option D is my least favorite. It shows zombies and victims the scene is too clear."
1325,Male,$0-30k,Black,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Card; Word; Trivia; Puzzle,,I prefer Option A because the humans are prepared to defend themselves against the immediate threat. I also like Option C as a secondary choice as well.
1326,Female,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Puzzle; Strategy; Word; Adventure; Trivia,,"Option A shows both the 'wave' of zombies, and a stronghold with humans inside standing on towers to shoot them down and defend their space. Option C also conveys the zombies, and the humans finding a place to stay safe, but it's not as clear to me as the stronghold is. Option B looks post-apocalytic, but I dont see any zombies. Option D is missing the safe place for humans."
1327,Female,$31-60k,Hispanic,Associate Degree,35-44,Trivia; Word; Card; Puzzle,,option C fits what I imagined because the scene look more realistic compared to the others.
1328,Male,$0-30k,White,High School,35-44,Arcade; Card; Puzzle; Trivia; Word,,"Ranked based on color saturation. A game with too bright colors doesn't really match the zombie aesthetic.,"
1329,Male,$0-30k,White,High School,45-54,Trivia; Word; Puzzle; Card; Board,,"I like the full images of zombies in the two photos, but the others don't clearly show them.  I don't particularly care for the houses."
1330,Female,$31-60k,White,Graduate Degree,25-34,Board; Puzzle; Simulation; Trivia; Word,,I imagine the zombies being active and trying to attack the humans. Option B is quite graphic and disturbing with the piles of bodies.
1331,Female,$0-30k,White,High School,55-64,Casino; Family; Puzzle; Trivia; Word,,Choice C seemed the most frightening picture which would match a zombie experience.
1332,Female,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Simulation; Strategy; Trivia; Word; Puzzle,,Option A and D clearly show the shelters and the struggle in the picture and fit the idea the best.
1333,Male,$0-30k,White,High School,55-64,Trivia; Word; Puzzle,,"My first choice shows an exciting version of the event described. All students of history know that holding the higher ground is a great advantage. Humans will always prevail over non-thinking zombies so having a stronghold is what survivors would eventually use to overcome the waves of undead. My least favorite options are those in which zombies and humans occupy the same level, relying on fences to keep the creatures at bay."
1334,Male,$0-30k,Hispanic,Associate Degree,25-34,Word; Trivia; Puzzle; Adventure; Action,,"A and C have best looking atmosphere and could convince me to play the game. B is alright, but it needs zombies. D looks cartoony in a bad way."
1335,Female,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Puzzle; Trivia; Word; Family; Educational,,"A- I want shelter and to be protected from the zombies and this fits perfectly, B- this shelter is nice but doesn't look like the setting for a zombie attack, D- I really don't want to be outside where I'm vulnerable, C- this looks like a nightmare, I don't want to die fighting zombies"
1336,Female,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Puzzle; Strategy; Word; Card; Trivia,,I think this image would more acruately portray was it would be like.
1337,Female,$0-30k,White,Graduate Degree,21-24,Puzzle; Word; Trivia; Arcade,,"B and D don't really look apocalyptic, especially D. D looks like the zombies just started attacking, while the other images indicate this an on-going thing that the humans are defending against"
1338,Female,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Puzzle; Trivia; Word,,"I picked C because it has a lot of trees, I would imagine world full of nature where people would have been hiding, maybe underground so there are no big buildings."
1339,Female,$61-100k,Hispanic,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Adventure; Puzzle; Trivia; Role Playing; Word,,"Option A has a rundown building and a horde of zombies nearby which is what my mind thinks of when humans are dealing with zombies. Option C wasn't as good to me as Option A because it shows the people away from shelter and super exposed which doesn't seem smart or realistic to me but it still seemed like a realistic situation. Option D felt super unrealistic because it's as if the zombies are waiting in line to attack, they'd more likely attack as a group like Option A & C. Option B shows no people or zombies it felt out of place."
1340,Female,$0-30k,Hispanic,Associate Degree,45-54,Educational; Puzzle; Trivia; Word,,I ranked them because of how random they all looked.
1341,Female,$61-100k,Black,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Trivia; Board; Word; Music; Puzzle,,I would select option A because this sounds like a bleak time. The picture in option A fits that. It's dark and grey. I don't picture trees during springtime like I see in some of the other images.
1342,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Sports; Strategy; Arcade; Adventure; Action,,the scene in option D fits my imagination because it shows humans trying to evacuate the zombie hoards
1343,Male,$31-60k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Strategy; Action; Adventure; Arcade; Role Playing,,"I like the vibrant color of the green trees in my top choice, and the red blood was compelling and caught my eye. Very cool design for sure!"
1344,Male,$61-100k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Strategy; Role Playing,,Choice A fits the idea of a zombie apocalypse. Choice A also fits the theme of being stuck in a shelter. Choice D is more panicked and not as sheltered as the story states.
1345,Male,$0-30k,White,High School,25-34,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Card; Role Playing,,"I picked what looked the most realistic with zombies and the world being destroyed to what didn't look as enticing as a world where zombies were running rampant. I think A and D fit the style the most and what would appear to be where all hell has broken loose. I think that C looks okay, but it is missing the environmental objects I would see more of. Lastly, I think that B just doesn't look as appealing even though it does look decent"
1346,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Sports; Racing; Arcade; Adventure; Action,,"I ranked my choices in order of most realistic images first. When I envisioned this scenario in my mind, it was very realistic, and less cartoony. However, judging by pure aesthetics, I really enjoyed option C."
1347,Male,$31-60k,Asian,Graduate Degree,25-34,Racing; Puzzle; Arcade; Adventure; Action,,showing the zombies attack and retreating scene of humans / also showing zombies attack but not clarifying enough humans retreat / showing shelter and human retreating bitterly while zombies attack is too high / only showing a calm shleter
1348,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Role Playing; Strategy,,I prefer the option A scene design because I like the zombie horde trying to get in the building like in several classic zombie movies and the giant zombie looks cool and exciting to see. I chose option B second because this building scene is less dynamic with less fortification along the walls of the building than shown in the option A game scene design. I chose option C third because the hero characters would not pile up zombies in large piles like shown in the option D game image nor fight in hand to hand combat like shown in the option D image if there is an easy escape route and the people are not cornered like in the option C image.
1349,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Adventure; Arcade; Card; Racing; Action,,I think C and A are the best. I say this because they look the most chaotic and seem like they fit the theme better than B and D. B and D just like of look like nothing is going on and it doesn__ seem like they fit the description well at all.
1350,Male,$31-60k,Hispanic,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Adventure; Arcade; Action,,"I like the idea of it looking like the world falling apart, so it needs to match that more."
1351,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Puzzle; Strategy,,I liked options A and C the best because they looks the most scary and I believe the most potential for being suspenseful. They are also more realistic looking than the alternatives.
1352,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Racing; Arcade; Board; Adventure; Action,,For me this level design fits best because you can tell that it very clearly was once a very normal and peaceful place that has now been turned into destruction and mayhem.
1353,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,25-34,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Racing; Simulation,,Option D best fits my imagination because it has the most modern vibe to it making it way more interesting to me as well as more relevant and real-life like.

(I'd have picked this if not for D, this is just a little bit under it.)A far shot bit too much, I liked the gate zombies and destruction, just not enough violence to it.B terrible and last, don't use. Saw no zombies."
1356,Female,$0-30k,White,High School,55-64,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Family; Puzzle,,Choice A has waves of zombies attacking the shelter as humans fire from above to kill the zombies. Choice C has a feeling of desperation as there are just a couple of humans trying to protect their ground from a continuous feed of Zombies. Choice D while it has zombies being killed this seems like a casual stroll of zombies as the line of zombies is so straight. Choice B is a house in fog that might be an image after an attack from the green blood but not a zombie or human body in sight so not an exciting image.
1357,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Sports; Role Playing; Arcade; Adventure; Action,,"Option B stands out the most. The landscape is well done, with the added fog features giving it a nice touch. The area looks spacious enough, but not over convoluted with alot of un neccessary stuff. It looks unique, and not similar to other games."
1358,Female,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,Role Playing; Racing; Arcade; Adventure; Action,,The scene seems to fit the best. It is scary and what I would imagine it would look like. This one caught my attention right away. I would not want to be in that world. Thank you.
1359,Male,$31-60k,Black,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Simulation; Strategy; Arcade; Adventure; Action,,Option C and A both show a sense of danger and urgency. Option C seems trapped on all sides. Option D looks a little too cartoonish and B only shows a building you can not tell how serious the situation is from it. Option B looks like a new and clean building.
1360,Male,$0-30k,White,High School,35-44,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Role Playing; Puzzle,,"When I think of a settlement in a zombie setting, I think of a place that can be easily defended from a predictable, to a point, enemy. Which leads to set defenses and walls. That would have both A and B stand out from the rest. What puts A above B is the fact that there are obvious, and in use, places to fire upon the zombie horde from. B can have the roof used for this, but the angles are tough to get any enemy that just rushes, or shambles, in waves and can reach the wall. It would be the better against human attackers but not zombies. I would prefer to see some cover for the shooters in A as well, but that is to cover the more human element of in fighting. D and C both feel like if they aren't the opening scenes of the game they don't really fit. Why would the humans, who would have time to set of a defense, be on the ground with the zombies unless there is a story element that isn't present in the prompt?"
1361,Male,$0-30k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Board; Card,,I prefer option A looks visually appealing. I find it stands out more.
1362,Male,$101k+,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Arcade; Action; Adventure,,Option D looks like a more realistic scenario because it still has normal vehicles and people depicted.  They__e been thrown into an apocalyptic scenario as opposed to the others or it looks like they__e been there for a while.
1363,Male,$0-30k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Role Playing; Strategy,,Options D and C look more like civilian areas and makeshift defenses. Makes it more challenging.
1364,Male,$61-100k,Asian,Graduate Degree,25-34,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Racing; Sports,,I ranked the scenes for a post apocalyptic zombie scene that I liked the most.   I really like how crazy the scene looked in option A the most followed by the image of option C followed by option D and then finally option B.
1365,Male,$61-100k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Adventure; Arcade,,"To me, A is the best representation of a scene featuring zombies encroaching on a shelter. It has that cool Stephen King style fog vibe, along with clearly establishing what is going on. C is similar in these regards which is why it is my second pic. I find D to be a good choice because it is a cool image, but I also do not think it fits the ""shelter"" prompt well, unless the shelter is a bus. B is a good image representing s zombie shelter, but it is also completely barren of the undead and survivors, making it visually boring."
1366,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Strategy; Board; Arcade; Adventure; Action,,"Option A is my first choice as it shows everything described, there are the wave of zombies that seem to be overwhelming the people while the people defend from their encampment which fits my imagination perfectly. Then option C and D would probably be voted fairly closely as in both photos it just shows survivors defending waves of zombies, which still aligns with the description given, however they don't have any  established shelters that I can see. Then option B is ranked last because while it is technically a shelter or what looks like one, there are no humans or zombies in sight, which is kind of the main point of the prompt."
1367,Male,$0-30k,White,High School,35-44,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Role Playing; Racing,,The dense fog and the hungry hoard converging hive this such a good look. Gives a sense of urgency good for gameplay.
1368,Male,$0-30k,White,High School,25-34,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Music; Puzzle,,I picked B and D as my top choices as the design and colors fit the game very well.
1369,Female,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Family; Arcade; Adventure; Action,,"Option A is quite realistic, because in a zombie attack, everyone would need to take Shelter or cover then attack from their cover as exposing oneself openly is not realistic as portrayed on the other design, so the best is to attack from a safe distance or attack to get to a safe distance, and this is what option A portrays."
1370,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Strategy; Word,,"A and b look kind of boring because it's not zoomed in on the action, it's just stuck on the house. Option c is the best because it's closer to the action and the colors are realistic"
1371,Male,$0-30k,Black,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Role Playing; Strategy,,The art style in Option A illustrates a sense of serenity with impending doom around the corner
1372,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Casino,,Option a has the most evocation of swarming whereas option b shows no zombies at all. I think when they are all in a line like d and c it doesn__ give the sense of urgency that something like a might
1373,Female,$31-60k,Hispanic,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Board,,"When I think of zombies and the apocalypse, I think of dreary colors and people totally unorganized and fighting just to survive. Plus everything is all falling apart. So A and C seemed to fit my imagination the most and D and B felt way too optimistic for new order zombie world to me."
1374,Male,$31-60k,White,Associate Degree,35-44,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Puzzle; Role Playing,,"C looks like the most realistic, the zombies have taken over the modern day. D looks similar but more at the very start of the apocalypse. B seems to be good but like it will be some years in and A seems like it is far into the apocalypse and people are trying to survive, so it's too far in the future given the description."
1375,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,35-44,Casino; Adventure; Arcade; Action; Role Playing,,I prefer the more realistic looking graphics rather than the cartoony looking ones.
1376,Male,$0-30k,Hispanic,Associate Degree,21-24,Simulation; Strategy; Arcade; Adventure; Action,,"My first choice is because of the look of the overgrown vegetation all on the building while there are swarms of undead. I think that's always been a cool way of portraying a zombie apocalypse with the survivor held up in a last stand sort of situation with a massive horde of zombies. My second choice is because it also has a similar feel to my first choice, but the environment doesn't look as interesting. I don't like the others that much because I find them to be too cartoony and colorful."
1377,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Arcade; Action; Adventure,,"I tend to like the more realistic, gritty takes on zombie stuff, so Option A is my favorite.  It feels the darkest and grittiest and realist.  It reminds me a lot of Days Gone, which I liked the look of a lot.  Option B is cool too, though.  It feels like it's still dark and moody, but in a cartoonish form.  I think that game would have to balance that look with satire and humor and being a little twisted for it to come off, though.  It couldn't just be a straight take on zombies or I think it would feel a little dull.  It should have an edge and sense of humor, like Borderlands or something, to fit the graphical style.  Option C is similar to Option A but I just find the graphics more generic and boring.  There's something missing from the look that makes it seem very generic and dull.  And then I like Option D the least.  The generic cartoony graphics just don't do anything for me.  They're not aesthetically pleasing and they also don't really augment the zombie theme at all, either with moody, grittiness like Option A, or with the potential for cartoonish twistedness in Option C."
1378,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Adventure; Action; Arcade,,"Choice C seems to depict the most accurate portrayal of post-apocalyptic scenes as seen in mainstream movies and television. There is destruction and chaos, but it's not so overwhelming that there is zero peace."
1379,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,25-34,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Board; Card,,Choice 1 because you have to take the high ground and have an actual structure. Choice c has all guns while my last choice has a guy with a medlee weapon.
1380,Male,$0-30k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Action; Adventure; Strategy; Arcade; Sports,,"I choose C, Because in the image it really tells and conveys me into that world that really gives me chills and it gives me more attention on this option. And for the others I rank them basically on my suggestion."
1381,Male,$0-30k,Black,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Role Playing; Puzzle; Arcade; Adventure; Action,,"Option A fits this description perfectly. The other pictures are kind of accurate, but A really highlights the zombie horde on their way to wreak havoc on a city."
1382,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Simulation; Racing; Arcade; Adventure; Action,,Option B was perfectly armed and it would protect us from the zombies
1383,Male,$0-30k,Asian,Associate Degree,25-34,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Role Playing; Simulation,,I chose the scenes that looked the most apocalyptic where the scenery is run down and smoky. It is the most realistic and sets the mood right for the game.
1384,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Role Playing; Simulation,,Things would be more like Option C. Zombies would be everywhere possible.
1385,Male,$31-60k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Board; Role Playing,,Option C looks the most convincing of the described world. Flora has overgrown and the infrastructure looks let go. Option A looks like a shelter piece milled together by people just trying to survive. Option D just looks too early in the timeline to match the scenario
1386,Male,$0-30k,White,High School,25-34,Role Playing; Board; Arcade; Adventure; Action,,"I feel like option A fits the tone of a 2020 zombie outbreak the best. Option A looks gritty and I like that. It looks like the survivors have found shelter and are trying their best to survive. Option C and B are pretty much tied as I feel the fit the tone second best. I like how the world kept growing as humanity is fallen. Option A, C, and B all do a good job at showing the world continue to go on no matter what is happening within it."
1387,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,21-24,Action; Arcade; Adventure; Puzzle; Word,,"I love the smokier, apocalyptic feel of the first few images. I also like that the scenes seem more downtrodden and hopeless, since that's exactly the condition the environment would be in during a zombie apocalypse. I'd like to see even more destitute places to really sell the whole feeling."
1388,Female,$0-30k,Black,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Strategy; Trivia,,"Feel like there would be mass panic and attacks first, then subtle dead silence of those who still live"
1389,Female,$0-30k,White,High School,25-34,Role Playing; Simulation; Arcade; Adventure; Action,,"B looks the most idyllic, as well as realistic. If that was a central compound there wouldn't be random hordes of zombies wandering. There'd be a clear zone where they'd be wiped out. A is if B had been breached. C and D both look like a goofy fortnite version of dying light."
1390,Male,$31-60k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Role Playing; Strategy,,I prefer the scene in option A because it feels the most wrecked and perfect for a post-apocalyptic zombie world. Option C and B have some potential too. Option D doesn't feel very zombie-like to me.
1391,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Role Playing; Simulation,,The fog adds a lot of atmosphere. I also like how the buildings are covered in moss and vines. Like nature is taking back the land because of the zombie attacks.
1392,Male,$61-100k,Black,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Sports,,I expect chaos in zombie invasions
1393,Male,$0-30k,White,High School,35-44,Sports; Arcade; Adventure; Action,,"In this hypothetical scenario, it's the year 2020, when humans are retreating from, hiding from, and fighting off deadly zombies. Scene A best suits this scenario because it shows people fighting off zombies from within a clearly-visible, defined hideaway, as noted in the description, or fortress. This brings to mind the hide-outs that characters in the TV series ""The Walking Dead"" holed up in, as well. Scene C also embodies this scenario well, as the scene shows lots of property damage, broken foliage, and an end-of-days, apocalyptic look to the scene. I can easily imagine zombies lining up, as in the illustration, while others hide behind the chain-link fence in the background to wait their turn to feed on human flesh. Scene D isn't that great a representation because the background objects like the building, the trees, and other objects look unharmed, so the scene looks too much untouched to be part of a war between humans and zombies. There should be some signs of distress, but it looks like an average, bright, sunny day to me. Scene B is the worst at capturing this scenario because there aren't any visible humans or zombies, unlike in the other three pictures. Scene B simply looks like an overcast day in the jungle or mountains, where I see an untouched, undamaged hideaway home. It looks more like something from the TV series ""Ozark"" on Netflix than a zombie apocalypse scene."
1394,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,65+,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Puzzle; Simulation,,"I think that the scene will be disorganized, and I ranked all of the aspects in the order of the chaos perceived"
1395,Male,$31-60k,White,Graduate Degree,45-54,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Trivia; Educational,,"Options C and D only depict cars and trucks, which don't fulfill my fantasy scenario of a temporary shelter from zombies. It has to be a dwelling and Option A looks most realistic here."
1396,Male,$61-100k,White,High School,35-44,Puzzle; Action; Adventure; Arcade; Strategy,,In my imagination a zombie invasion is much more chaotic like in C and D
1397,Male,$61-100k,Black,Associate Degree,25-34,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Puzzle; Role Playing,,"I live in an urban city where there are a lot of people. I ordered the scenes based on what looked most likely for where I lived. A is last for example because trees and leaves wouldn't have grown so quickly over buildings by just 2020. D has taxis, bus, and piles of bodies which would seem consistent with where I live in the world."
1398,Male,$101k+,Black,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Role Playing,,I like the edgier field of A and C which look as though things are more chaotic.  Options D and B look too friendly.
1399,Male,$0-30k,White,High School,25-34,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Music; Role Playing,,"For these, I voted them in order of how frantic they look, my first option shows zombies completely swarming their base, this makes the game seem more interesting, each other choice the amount is less by less, and the 4th is just no zombies at all."
1400,Male,$61-100k,Black,High School,25-34,Sports; Racing; Arcade; Adventure; Action,,"Option A seem more realistic to a zombie outbreak, in which people will find a building for shelter and create a barrier for more support to fight off enemies. Option C is also a good look where sometimes you have to go out to get supplies and encounter zombies. Also both option A and C have abandon vehicles that seem like people was using what ever they can get a hold on for their survival. Option B shows not activity as if there was only a handful of zombie attacks. Option D is a cleaner version where they pile up the dead zombies in a pile and have cleaner vehicles (seem more safe)."
1401,Female,$31-60k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Role Playing; Strategy,,"In the zombie scenario, the best scene that would match my existence or plan would be option A.  Option A is a house in the middle of mostly nowhere (we are middle of nowhere), where they have perimeter fencing and are trying to just survive.  That would be very similar to what we would do for real, as we live in the middle of nowhere and would just hunker down.  Option B was my next choice, because again it's a house/building in the woods, kind of middle of nowhere and fortified.  Option C was my third choice, because I can't imagine trying to line zombies through buses and cars in a parking lot.  I would not be doing that, and would rather be hiding on my own property.  Option D was my last option/pick, because the ""survivors"" are actively fighting the zombies in a parking lot.  The unlikeliness of this entire scenario is crazy insane, and it would never happen to me.  Hence, why option D was my final choice.  I more imagine that life would be more secluded on our own property, since we have it set up for 85% self-sustained and no one accesses it - aside from us."
1402,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,21-24,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Strategy; Role Playing,,"I have to say that all four of these game designs have merit. Options C and A are the strongest contenders in my opinion because they emphasize the constant struggle to survive against all odds and the vital important of finding a hardened shelter to hole up in and defend. C and A show survivors battling from inside a fenced compound and a fortified building, both of which make sense. I like Option B as well, but the perimeter walls seem weak and are not a place I would want to stay long. C is my least favorite since there doesn't seem to be a place to defend and it's just out in the open."
1403,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Strategy; Role Playing,,Options A and C look like they have the most zombies and most action. Good graphics and screen layout.
1404,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,35-44,Role Playing; Board; Arcade; Adventure; Action,,"Option A is my first choice because it looks like it would be well protected and a good position to defend.  The art style matches what I would expect a game in this style to look like, which captures a sense of semi-realism.  Option C looks like our characters are in trouble or they are trying to get to the red farmhouse shelter.  The colors and art in Option C are suitable to this type of game.  Option B looks like a decent shelter to defend, but I wouldn't choose this style unless you are going for a more cartoony look.  The colors are too bright and I'm not a fan of the art style in option D."
1405,Female,$31-60k,White,Vocational Training,25-34,Adventure; Action; Role Playing; Arcade; Simulation,,"I feel like C would be the best image since, you see people running from the zombies while looking for the established shelters. You see people in the streets with weapons killing the zombies and anyone that gets in their way. as you see the dead bodies with blood laying on the ground."
1406,Male,$61-100k,Hispanic,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Adventure; Puzzle; Action; Strategy; Arcade,,A and C look like i think it would with worn down things and crumbling buildings and such
1407,Male,$61-100k,Hispanic,High School,35-44,Puzzle; Role Playing; Arcade; Adventure; Action,,The first choice was very realistic for the description that was written. The second choice fit the time and the environment that was written in the description. The third choice was able to fit the description but the pictures choice is a little too bare. The last choice was because it did not match the description and the graphics are too cartoonish.
1408,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,45-54,Puzzle; Trivia; Action; Adventure; Arcade,,I like the realistic view of the world and the gated buildings.
1409,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,35-44,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Role Playing; Strategy,,"the images that best rank stage what for me is a fighting environment in an apocalyptic world, it shows shelters and a gloomy environment"
1410,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Strategy; Action; Adventure; Arcade; Puzzle,,in descending order it looks like an actual shelter and tapers down to just regular streets.  i chose d as last because it looks to clean and cartoony to be the scene of an apocalypse
1411,Male,$0-30k,Black,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Role Playing; Arcade; Adventure; Action,,"Options C, D and A fit my imagination for the most part, when I think of the scene. Option B is a bit too peaceful, and at first glance, I can't really tell there were even zombies around. Option C does a great job showing a true struggle against waves of zombies. Option D does that too."
1412,Male,$0-30k,Hispanic,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Card; Role Playing,,I really like B as I feel that the image has a very ominous feel to it. It seems like the calm before the storm and I think that really sets it apart from the other options.
1413,Male,$0-30k,White,High School,25-34,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Role Playing,,since the imagined situation is a zombie apoclypse. i would imagine something like the first choice (a) to be more representative of this disaster.
1414,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,45-54,Puzzle; Sports; Arcade; Adventure; Action,,The  scene looks so real i almost believed it happened in real time.
1415,Male,$0-30k,Hispanic,High School,25-34,Strategy; Arcade; Simulation; Adventure; Action,,A) this seems a lot more ugent the zombie hord is going to overrun the survivors. B) no action or zombies seen at all. D) the base is almost not in the picture. C)A lot more  urgency and action the base is under attack but can withstand the assault.
1416,Female,$0-30k,White,Associate Degree,25-34,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Music; Puzzle,,"""A"" fits the description best, with a shelter that is being encroached upon in an attack.  'C' is similar, with zombies attacking a shelter that is being defended.  'D' looks more like a mass shooting, and 'B' just looks like a nice home, no invasion happening."
1417,Male,$0-30k,Other,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Role Playing; Puzzle,,C and A seem like scenes in a dark and serious zombie game. I like it though because it looks the most realistic. B is the same minus the zombies. D has more color to it. Would fit more of a not as serious game. More of a fun and not so serious game.
1418,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,Arcade; Adventure; Action,,"When I think of zombie post-apocalyptic scenes, these are the ones that first come to mind"
1419,Female,$31-60k,Hispanic,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Arcade; Card; Puzzle; Action; Adventure,,So I tried to pick the scene that would be most like today. The inclusion of the school bus and taxi made D my favorite choice. I imagine most people will be in cities or towns trying to escape zombies.
1420,Male,$0-30k,Black,High School,25-34,Role Playing; Board; Arcade; Adventure; Action,,"A has the best example of holding down the fort , or mankind on the edge of the end. B looks eerie and I wish it looked more damaged but A and B have basically strong holds. C and d do look dangerous but are kind off straight forward and generic."
1421,Male,$0-30k,Hispanic,Less than High School Diploma,25-34,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Role Playing; Simulation,,"A is best because i imagine a highly fortified fortress where it would constantly be under siege from zombies. B is next because I feel they would never be truly without zombies, D and C are last because the fortress is weak and seems like a quick thing that was thrown together fast and as a last ditch effort."
1422,Male,$31-60k,Asian,Graduate Degree,25-34,Action; Adventure; Arcade,,C and D gives more details in what is going on and shows the people and how they deal with fighting the zombies. A is good for showing people defending a building. B doesn't show any people or zombies.
1423,Female,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,55-64,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Strategy; Puzzle,,I chose D as the scene that fits humans struggling against zombies. I think you would have massive amounts of people trying to get away and take cover. D looks like a realistic time with the buildings and vehicles I like that.
1424,Male,$61-100k,White,Associate Degree,55-64,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Strategy; Sports,,"A better depiction of chaos and regrouping, after all, they are ""Zombies"" right?"
1425,Male,$0-30k,White,High School,35-44,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Strategy; Sports,,I choose option A first because it depicts a series of waves of zombies and also different shelters like as described. I choose option C because It also does a good job fitting the description with the wave of zombies and also shelters nearby. I picked option D third because it is similar to option C in the way it looks with the vehicles and waves of zombies. Finally I picked option C last because it doesnt really depict zombies however it could be a scene inbetween waves or when first establishing a new shelter.
1426,Male,$0-30k,White,High School,21-24,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Puzzle; Card,,"I liked D best because the map was the clearest. It was the easiest to see all of the different enemies. B was colorful and mysterious, and A felt very similar, but it wasn't as easy to see all of the zombies which is why it was last."
1427,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,25-34,Strategy; Arcade; Adventure; Action,,Option a looks more realistic and depicts the description of the scenario best. It shows an established shelter and a hoard of zombies pushing the humans deeper into their shelter. Option b is less realistic looking but also depicts a shelter. Options C depicts a more realistic take graphically compared to option D but it feels like the humans have nowhere to go and no shelter to retreat to.
1428,Male,$101k+,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Trivia; Puzzle; Arcade; Adventure; Action,,"A looks the most detailed, but then I do like the color and style of B, C looks pretty realistic and detailed, and D doesn't look like it has very much detail at all, it looks low quality to me."
1429,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Simulation; Arcade; Adventure; Action,,"FIrst I will explain why I ranked B last - it looks like just a place of living and doesn't give any indication of what the game is. I liked D better than C because it looks like the main character in D is really in the thick of it, really in the middle of more dangerous (and thus more fun) action as it were. Lastly, A had to go third because it was better than B but not as good as D and C."
1430,Male,$31-60k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Adventure; Puzzle; Action; Arcade; Sports,,"Options A and C capture the scene and set the tone the best - you can really see the struggle with how worn down the buildings look, and the wave of zombies clearly looks more threatening than Options D and B. Option B felt the most unlikely to convey the scene properly because of how bright and less worn down the building looks. Even though Option D showed some kind of conflict, the brighter colors did not convey it to be as serious compared to Option C."
1431,Female,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Role Playing; Word; Adventure; Arcade; Action,,"B comes in last for me because the scene just looks entirely too quiet and clean. I realize if you are trying to avoid being seen and heard, quiet is good, but it just looks way too spruced up and with far too little activity. Humans would start to stir and get cocky over time. D also ranks low for me. I can't really tell what is going on with the scene beyond a pile of bodies and blood splatter everywhere, which I get, but it just looks entirely too messy for the scene without the compound in view, and yet the background looks tidy. My first choice was A because it looks more realistic. The place is run down, and then there is a hoard on the loose at the compound, perhaps due to noise or humans scent or some event. C also looks fairly realistic for similar reason. The compound is run down, zombies are trickling in, and it just seems more like what could be happening."
1432,Male,$31-60k,Black,High School,25-34,Simulation; Strategy; Arcade; Adventure; Action,,"Option A looks the most like I would imagine a post apocalyptic world would look like. Its fortified, there's fire, and it's obvious someone's using it as an encampment. Option C also look pretty good with the fire and the care, but both option C and D bother me because zombie's would not walk in a straight line like that. Option B is too pristine and in too good of condition to be in a zombie apocalypse"
1433,Female,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,21-24,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Casino; Strategy,,"I chose Option A first because when i think of a zombie apocalypse, i like the idea of building your own compound/base and trying your best to keep it safe and prevent it from getting overrun. The view of all of the zombies trying to get in the main gate is a really good visual of what struggles would come along with that. I chose Optuon D last because I think it's too bright and the cars are all in way too good of shape; the yellow vehicle looks brand new. The zombies are also walking in too straight of a line, it looks more like people waiting in line for something"
1434,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,35-44,Strategy; Action; Adventure; Arcade; Puzzle,,"Option A really gives you a sense of the carnage that has taken place. The smoke adds an eerie look to it. The realism is better than the other options. The scenery feels more involving and that there is depth and history behind it. The destruction and warzone like appearance is nice. Overall, it just gives the impression that a lot has happened and that the situation is bleak."
1435,Male,$31-60k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,Simulation; Role Playing; Arcade; Adventure; Action,,Option A was the most intense scene so that was my first choice. I followed with the next most intense scene and so on.
1436,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,21-24,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Racing; Role Playing,,C is first because I imagine an area of the road is over taken and smoke in the area with blood on the road from things and people that are getting destroyed. A is also a possibility because there is lots of smoke and the zombies would be trying to overtake a building. D would be next in my imagination because the land is a little more open but there are more zombies trying to attack people. Cars are stopped and mayhem is happening. B is last because there are lots of zombies but not many people outside being attacked. It is still a possibility but the least likely one that I imagine.
1437,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Puzzle; Strategy,,Option A best shows the concept of waves of zombies and humans retreated to shelters. Option C shows waves of zombies well but not shelters. And option B was my last choice because of the lack of zombies.
1438,Male,$0-30k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Simulation; Adventure; Arcade; Role Playing; Action,,I picked A first because it looks like the most damaged and hopeless. I picked C next because it looks like in the wilderness and there's a lot of damage. D looks like a scene that's not as hard as the others. B just looks like a generic scene that doesn't have anything to do with an apocalypse.
1439,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,Simulation; Role Playing; Arcade; Adventure; Action,,"Option A stands out from the rest. It's exactly the scenario I had in my mind of a zombie apocalypse. Option C is also good, it looks realistic. Options B & D, the scenes look too clean. I'm expecting chaos."
1440,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Board; Sports,,option C is the best scenario that represents my imagination to the given situation. the setting is realistic.
1441,Female,$101k+,White,Associate Degree,25-34,Action; Adventure; Arcade,,"The more chaotic scenery is what I imagine, which is why I picked C first because of all the people and the zombie attacks"
1442,Female,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,55-64,Action; Puzzle; Strategy; Trivia; Word,,"My imagination went with A, but I really like C. That could be really cute."
1443,Male,$0-30k,White,High School,35-44,Simulation; Music; Word; Trivia; Puzzle,,"Option A looks the most ""hardcore"", as far as a post-apocalyptic scenario.  Option A looks like she has been through a lot an her face looks like she has been hardened by the consistently stressful situations and thinks in a survival-mode, without letting her emotions get in the way. She also is wearing pants, so it seems she has long forgotten about vanity.  Option B looks second best.  More playful and possibly deceptive. She looks like she kept a bit of femininity possible to make people trust her.  Option C just looks like an evil disney character and less like a real person connected to reality."
1444,Female,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,55-64,Educational; Board; Puzzle; Trivia; Word,,"Option c is my first choice by far, confident, assertive and ready to do battle is what I perceive from this character. Option b is okay, the expression is more timid, option c looks fun and playful but i would question the ability to defend"
1445,Female,$31-60k,White,High School,55-64,Puzzle; Trivia; Word; Music,,"Option A is serious. And so it should be in a world of battling Zombies, they are deadly and not to be taken lightly. This depicts that and is clearly designed. Face and body are perfectly constructed into a real human being. Option B is somewhat alike to that. But it lacks clarity. It seems sloppily done. Face is not looking at me. It has choppy edges. Option C is cute and funny. Nothing like how it is in reality with zombies. Not going over well with me. Too happy, zombies are depressing."
1446,Female,$31-60k,Black,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Trivia; Word; Puzzle; Educational; Simulation,,"A none of these are right. A woman is not going to wear a skirt in this situation. Only on someone's fantasies. It's really practical, abnormal and dumb."
1447,Female,$101k+,White,Graduate Degree,55-64,Word; Trivia; Puzzle,,I prefer the realism of A given the nature of this game; I want a character that looks strong and confident and like she wouldn't let any zombie get past her.  B doesn't look as ready to fight and C just looks silly and I really don't like it for a zombie game.
1448,Female,$31-60k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Arcade; Puzzle; Role Playing; Trivia; Word,,The first one still looks animated and the last one is too Disney for this theme
1449,Female,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Arcade; Puzzle; Trivia; Word; Educational,,"I like the quirky looking one the best. Choice B is kind of tough looking but still unique. Choice A is all toughness, I like a little personality."

1451,Male,$61-100k,Asian,Graduate Degree,25-34,Word; Trivia; Puzzle; Arcade; Action,,"A zombie apocalypse makes me imagine a dark, gritty world where survival is the most important thing. With that in mind, Option A makes the most sense to me since the quasi-realistic design seems to better fit a dark, gritty world."
1452,Female,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,Puzzle; Trivia; Word; Role Playing,,"A is the best. If it__ a game about fighting zombies, the person needs to look serious and badass. The character in C is way too cutesy for a zombie game"
1453,Female,$31-60k,White,Vocational Training,65+,Puzzle; Word; Trivia,,"""A"" has a very serious look about her, and holds that crossbow like she means to use it. ""C"" looks too happy, so that leaves ""B"" for the middle choice. I like that ""A"" looks like she's been through some things yet willing to go through more if necessary."
1454,Female,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Strategy; Word; Puzzle; Trivia,,The more realistic the better - it gives more excitement to the game. So I ranked the images in order of realism from most to least.
1455,Female,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Trivia; Word; Educational; Puzzle; Strategy,,"I prefer option A because this character seems more fitting to the scenario described above, clothing colors are more muted and she is serious and looks more confident and powerful compared to other characters in A and C."

1457,Female,$0-30k,Black,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Trivia; Word; Family; Puzzle; Action,,"A and B are more fitting for the scenarios and they look hardy and prepared. Option C looks too casual and careless, I wouldn't want to play this character, I want someone more serious."
1458,Female,$31-60k,White,High School,45-54,Card; Puzzle; Trivia; Word,,My first choice looks like a strong fighter ready for anything. Good fit. Second one ok but looks pretty scared. Last choice looks cartoony. Not a good fit for the genre.
1459,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Strategy; Trivia; Word; Role Playing; Puzzle,,I prefer the serious and realistic style of option A. It adds an element of scariness to a very dire sounding situation. B would be my next choice because it is similar to A. C doesn__ appeal to me in this scenario because it is too cartoonish and cute. I do like the art though.
1460,Female,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Arcade; Card; Puzzle; Trivia; Word,,A by a mile because she looks like a total bada** to me.
1461,Female,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,Arcade; Puzzle; Music; Trivia; Word,,"I chose A as my first choice because the weapon style fits my imagination as being the most effective. I chose B as my second choice because I feel that the expression on her face looks like she is ready for combat and isn't playing around. I feel that the style of weapon fits the scene I imagine. I chose C as my third choice because I feel the weapon style is bold, strong, and she is confident in her usage."
1462,Female,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,55-64,Arcade; Puzzle; Word; Trivia,,I like the looks of my choices in that order. They look a little evil in that order
1463,Female,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,55-64,Card; Puzzle; Simulation; Trivia; Word,,option a is most lifelike and looks the most aggressive.  Option b looks less lifelike yet more so than option c.  Option c looks cartoon-like and not threatening at all.

1465,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,21-24,Educational; Trivia; Word; Puzzle; Simulation,,A is most realistic bodily wise. I also don't think the character would make sense in a skirt
1466,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Puzzle; Word; Trivia; Casino; Card,,I ranked them in the way that I viewed how serious they looked and how realistic their overall feature were.

1468,Male,$101k+,White,High School,45-54,Action; Casino; Puzzle; Trivia; Word,,A looks like what I imagined when reading the description.  B is slightly worse and the shorts are not appropriate for zombie killing.  C  is too cartoony and happy.
1469,Female,$61-100k,White,High School,35-44,Word; Puzzle; Casino; Strategy; Trivia,,"Option B was my first choice because it was a good middle ground. Option A is a little too real looking for my taste, and option C is too cartoonish and immature looking. Option B was right in the middle where I could imagine the character as real, yet not too real that it makes me feel uncomfortable."
1470,Female,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Word; Card; Trivia; Strategy; Puzzle,,Option A looks the most realistic to me and option C is very imaginative. Option B is slightly realistic with a cartoon-ish quality to it. I guess I am drawn to real-life looking characters.
1471,Female,$0-30k,White,High School,55-64,Puzzle; Trivia; Word; Music; Strategy,,The lady is not smiling and that makes her feel more realistic in this scenario. She seems intense.  Def don't like the cartoon version at all.
1472,Female,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,55-64,Trivia; Word; Puzzle,,A looks fierce and confident and I like it even though I don't like guns.  C looks too comical for such a serious situation.  B has gratuitous sensuality which is not practical or needed.
1473,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,25-34,Trivia; Puzzle; Action; Strategy; Word,,"A looks gritty and realistic. C is too cartoonish and B is too ""cute"" for me."
1474,Female,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Arcade; Card; Puzzle; Word; Trivia,,Option A seems the most realistic.  You would be dirty and you probably would not try to dress cute.  The mini skirt does not fit the atmosphere.
1475,Female,$101k+,White,Graduate Degree,45-54,Board; Trivia; Word; Card; Puzzle,,I like the more realistic look of option A. Option C looks too cartoony for me to take serious.

1477,Female,$61-100k,Hispanic,Graduate Degree,25-34,Adventure; Puzzle; Role Playing; Trivia; Word,,I like the realistic design of the first one and that she__ wearing pants. The second one is ok. The third is too cutesy.

1479,Female,$31-60k,White,Graduate Degree,55-64,Adventure; Card; Puzzle; Trivia; Word,,A looks like a good character for zombie wars.  They are serious and tough.  B is good also for the same reasons.  C looks more like a comical character and doesn't really fit in.
1480,Female,$31-60k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Word; Trivia; Strategy; Puzzle; Card,,Character A seems unkempt which would be one that is struggling to survive they don't have time for haircuts or styling or cute clothes

1486,Male,$101k+,White,Graduate Degree,45-54,Casino; Racing; Word; Puzzle; Trivia,,I ranked from the most realistic-looking to the most stylized. A zombie apocalypse is a serious issue! I would want my heroine to be appropriately serious looking.
1487,Female,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,65+,Puzzle; Trivia; Word,,Option A shows a serious woman with a gun primed to shoot. Option C is just too cute for a zombie attack and in Option B the woman looks too demure to fight zombies.
1488,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Puzzle; Educational; Card; Trivia; Word,,"I like A the best because she looks like she's ready to take on zombies. It feels like she's already been through some things, so it gives the character some depth right away."

1491,Female,$0-30k,White,High School,35-44,Music; Word; Trivia; Card; Puzzle,,"I voted for option B as number 1 because that character looks the most like I would expect someone who is struggling to survive a zombie apocalypse would look, injured, dirty, hungry, holding a weapon but not as if it's what they really want to do. I put option A second because she looks like someone who is well-equipped to fight zombies, and option C is last because she doesn't seem to fit the scenario at all - looks too happy."
1492,Female,$101k+,White,High School,55-64,Board; Educational; Puzzle; Trivia; Word,,Clothing needs to be functional.  Long pants and sleeves would be good to protect arms and legs.

1494,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,55-64,Arcade; Family; Puzzle; Trivia; Word,,"I prefer this one a more fair fight a woman and her crossbow only. To me using magic is not good, only pure skill and good weapon is all you need"
1495,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Puzzle; Card; Word; Trivia,,"The more realistic the character, the more I will be able to immerse myself in the story. Option A is not cartoony at all and the character is wearing clothes that would be useful when fighting zombies. Option B is more sexualized and Option C does not look like a real person."
1496,Female,$31-60k,White,Graduate Degree,25-34,Puzzle; Racing; Board; Trivia; Word,,Seems most tough and ready for survival.
1497,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,65+,Puzzle; Trivia; Arcade; Card; Word,,"Character A fits the world described. B and C are comic booky, one a seeming celebrity chick and the other a childish imp. i would riff off the tough Mom in Terminator as a model."
1498,Female,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Puzzle; Arcade; Casino; Word; Trivia,,"I chose A because it is a more realistic zombie fighting outfit.  Hostly, who is going to fight sombies holding and apple and wearing short shorts."
1499,Female,$31-60k,White,Associate Degree,45-54,Card; Puzzle; Word; Trivia,,I like A the best because she looks the most realistic. I would prefer a realistic type game about zombies versus a fantasy type game. I also like option B. She looks like she would be a tough person and would fight well. Option C seems to happy and perky to be fighting zombies.
1500,Female,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,Puzzle; Trivia; Sports; Word,,The first two I picked show what looks like a real human where the last one is elf like and not really a good fit in my opinion.
1501,Female,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,Word; Trivia; Puzzle,,"Option B is my choice because the style most closely resembles what I might create for myself.  I love the coat and the short hairstyle.  I also like the shorts of Option B as that seems like it would be the easiest in which to move around.  As a second option, I like the seriousness of Option A, the very no-nonsense look that she has, including the long coat and the expression on her face.  Option C simply looks the least realistic of the three which is what puts that option at third place for me.  I like the placement of the weapon in each Option as it is handy and ready to use.  Options B and A both look like they are on alert and ready to handle any zombie situation that arises more than Option C."
1502,Female,$61-100k,White,Associate Degree,25-34,Action; Strategy; Trivia; Puzzle; Word,,"I chose option A as my first because she seems the most realistic in choice of survivor who__ battling a zombie apocalypse. She is easier to resonate because she looks so realistic. I think she would take you further into character mode and just overall embodies that she__ in the middle of the war and I__ living vicariously through her.  From the details on her jacket and the dog tags showing her previous life and values to the bandage on her face.Option B although similar to A in style besides her leg wrapped which I think should of been done to A instead of B, is more animated. For the feeling to be apocalyptic and like she was pulled from one life to another I think realism is more important. I also don__ understand the green ball in her hand which is fine but when I__ thinking of the initial description and what fits option B doesn__ make as much sense as A.Option C is just too __isney like_ or Pixar or child like. It doesn__ scream to me I__ killing zombies or I__ stuck to survive. She seems to me like she could fit as a character in Eragon or like something more PG. I don__ resonate with her emotionally or physically in any way. So when I think of the circumstance described in the beginning I feel option C would be my last choice."
1503,Female,$101k+,White,Graduate Degree,65+,Board; Card; Puzzle; Trivia; Word,,I definitely like the one that is more animated and a bit friendlier looking.
1504,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,Puzzle; Strategy; Trivia; Board; Word,,"Option A, the character is standing firm with a mean look on her face, and is ready to use her weapon. Option B, she has a weapon, but not ready to use it. Option C, the person looks too happy to be somebody in a battle."
1505,Female,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,Adventure; Arcade; Puzzle; Trivia; Word,,"Option A was my first choice because, in my imagination, the world is a dark, dangerous place in which only the strong and gritty survive - as well as, occasionally, the very lucky people who might not necessarily be strong and gritty! So, the most realistic version, version A, fits with that scenario, to me. The woman looks strong and determined, and her clothes, while not unfashionable, are more functional that not. Her expression and demeanor also make sense to me in this situation. Also, I've watched a lot of zombie movies and The Walking Dead episodes, and A is most reminiscent of that look and vibe. Option B would be okay but the short-shorts, fitted jacket that looks like leather (vs. A's sturdier-looking jacket) and less-realistic look doesn't appeal to me for this fictional situation. And Option C doesn't fit my imagination of this scenario because the woman looks almost elf-like, more of a Disney character than a gritty zombie situation. A works best, to me, because it conveys strength, will to survive, skill, and practicality mixed with determination. B and C seem to emphasize showing skin and looking sexy or whimsical; certainly, sexy whimsical women can also be badasses! But that's not what comes to mind / fits my imagination, here."
1506,Female,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Puzzle; Trivia; Word; Family; Educational,,"A- this gal is tough and she's taking zero shit from zombies and I want to be on her team when the zombies arrive, B- this girl looks a little apprehensive, you cannot be apprehensive while encountering zombies, that simply won't work, C- she looks a little too friendly which isn't a great look while fighting zombies- we cannot keep retreating, we have to fight back, come on people, we are faster and stronger than zombies!"
1507,Female,$0-30k,White,High School,35-44,Puzzle; Word; Trivia; Card; Board,,"A looks like she's actually ""been through"" the scenario. She looks mad, angry, and ready to fight. B is ok, but just looks a bit too cartoon-y, kind of like a cartoon Instagram influencer that just found herself in the situation. I'm not a fan of C at all, and her look is almost patronizing, given the severity of the scenario."
1508,Female,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Puzzle; Role Playing; Trivia; Word,,A looks like someone determined to fight for what they need. B looks like the next best choice. C just looks way too happy for this to be a life or death type situation.
1509,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Trivia; Word; Arcade; Puzzle; Music,,"Option A looks more ""real world, which is appropriate for a zombie conflict.

1513,Female,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Puzzle; Educational; Trivia; Word,,I voted for choice A because she is the most realistic looking to me. She looks like she is a brave zombie fighter that doesn't take anything from anybody or anything.  She looks like a leader to me.
1514,Female,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Simulation; Trivia; Word; Family; Puzzle,,I chose the option that seemed the least sexualized while also still being realistic looking
1515,Female,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,65+,Board; Card; Puzzle; Trivia; Word,,"I chose A first because the character looks serious and prepared to shoot if needed. B looks like she is not feeling well and may be close to death, not ready to fight the zombies. I chose C last because it looks too much like a cartoon and the character is too happy."
1516,Female,$0-30k,Black,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Trivia; Word; Card; Family; Puzzle,,A is most realistic and she looks ready for war and the dirtiness of the clothing gives it more of a wow factor.
1517,Female,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Puzzle; Adventure; Casino; Trivia; Word,,A is my top choice because it looks realistic for the scenario described.  Her clothes and her holding a bow makes her look serious and like she is ready to fight the zombies.  I then picked B as I don't think that someone fighting off zombies would wear a skirt but I do like the look of the coat.  I then picked C as it looks too whimsical and I don't think it fits well at all with the theme.  Especially don't like her face.
1518,Female,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,Puzzle; Trivia; Word,,"I want full body coverage, I'm not trying to look sexy, I am trying to survive.  Visible skin can be bitten by zombies/scratched by zombies, or scratched by rusty crap and give you an infection."
1519,Male,$61-100k,Black,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Adventure; Puzzle; Card; Word; Trivia,,A looks like the right fit for someone participating in a zombie apocalypse. B is better than C because C looks too happy go lucky

1521,Female,$31-60k,Black,Bachelor's Degree,55-64,Strategy; Word; Arcade; Puzzle; Trivia,,My first choice is what I imagine a Zombie fighter to look like. The next two choices for me has absolutely nothing to do with a Zombie. They look more like a person trying to sell an apple. Choice three the lady is smiling.

1522,Female,$0-30k,White,Graduate Degree,45-54,Card; Puzzle; Strategy; Trivia; Word,,"The style that fits my imagination of a character or person who is living in a world that has changed dramatically because a large number of zombies encroached on human existence and they are struggling against waves of zombies, other humans, and trying to establish safe shelters is Choice A. Choice A's character isn't wearing sexy shorts or a skirt--as a woman I laugh at how many people portray women in times of crisis wearing the sexiest outfits. We wouldn't wear anything of the sort. This character looks like she's in a zombie apocalypse and her clothing shows it. Her jacket is worn down and dirty and her face is serious and alert. The other two options look too gamey."

1525,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,25-34,Music; Puzzle; Card; Trivia; Word,,"Option A seems the most practical. The long pants seem important for an apocalypse. The shorts in B and C seem unreasonable, and option C seems too whimsical. Options B and C are also holding a ball - how are you supposed to use a crossbow when you're playing with a ball?"
1526,Female,$61-100k,Black,High School,55-64,Trivia; Word; Racing; Puzzle; Music,,The long coat on Option B is my first choice because it's very sleek and stylish. I like the long pants on Option A as my second choice. Option C is my least favorite because I don't like the profile shot.
1527,Male,$0-30k,Black,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Card; Word; Trivia; Puzzle,,I prefer Option A because the character looks very serious-minded and appears to be prepared for whatever comes forth.
1528,Female,$31-60k,Hispanic,Associate Degree,35-44,Trivia; Word; Card; Puzzle,,"option A is what I imagine because she looks the most like a fighter and eager to get things done, not playing a game but real life."
1529,Male,$0-30k,White,High School,35-44,Arcade; Card; Puzzle; Trivia; Word,,"Option A is the best one for the theme, based on style and colors."
1530,Female,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Board; Strategy; Trivia; Puzzle; Word,,"A- This character looks like she's capable of surviving and well equippedB- too much exposed skin, not good with possible blood born pathogens/zombies.  The apple does nothing for the aestheticC not gritty enough for a survivalist, reminds me of fairy type character."
1531,Male,$0-30k,White,High School,45-54,Trivia; Word; Puzzle; Card; Board,,She is the most realistic looking character.  And bad a$$.
1532,Female,$31-60k,White,Graduate Degree,25-34,Board; Puzzle; Simulation; Trivia; Word,,"Option A looks more weathered, like she's been through some stuff. Option B is fine, but she looks too put-together. Option C is too cute for the scenario."
1533,Female,$0-30k,White,High School,55-64,Casino; Family; Puzzle; Trivia; Word,,Option A seems the most bad ass out of the three pics and that is why I chose A.  Not sure what the other two are holding in their hands but it looks like a green apple???
1534,Female,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Simulation; Strategy; Trivia; Word; Puzzle,,"Option A seems the most realistic with it being rugged and rough looking, you aren't going to be thinking about being sexy or cleaned up."
1535,Male,$0-30k,White,High School,55-64,Trivia; Word; Puzzle,,A realistic and healthy human is my choice for the best character avatar. Option B is too skinny and doesn't seem to support the vision of the world described. Option C seems to be too whimsical for the premise.
1536,Female,$31-60k,White,High School,35-44,Music; Puzzle; Racing; Trivia; Word,,B I chose as she is less intimidating but looks like she wants to get work done. A reminded me of the walking dead and C just looked like she was going out for a stroll not caring about zombies and just wants to frolic
1537,Male,$0-30k,Hispanic,Associate Degree,25-34,Word; Trivia; Puzzle; Adventure; Action,,A is realistic and looks like a zombie apocalypse survivor. B is nice for a more stylized option. C looks too goofy and not serious enough.
1538,Non-binary,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Word; Trivia; Strategy; Simulation; Puzzle,,I chose A because the character looks like she has been through actual struggle (looks less clean) and she has a more resilient look on her face than option B. Option C is just too happy for the scenario to make sense.
1539,Female,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,Puzzle; Word; Trivia; Casino,,I picked option C first because the person looks like they are in a bizarre state of mind and would do anything to harm another being.   Option B is lurking around like they may demolish the first being three see.  And option A will simply shoot first and ask questions later.
1540,Female,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,55-64,Word; Trivia; Puzzle; Casino; Card,,My choices were based on the facial expressions.  'C' seemed most zombie-like to me.  The eyes were wide open with a  smirk expression.  'B' had a blank expression and the head was looking down. 'A' was less zombie-like because the figure had a stance and regular look.
1541,Female,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Puzzle; Strategy; Word; Card; Trivia,,I like the more realistic characters. It is easier to be able to get into a game when the character resemble real people.
1542,Male,$0-30k,White,High School,25-34,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Card; Role Playing,,A and B are basically tied for what I would expect to see someone look like in combat versus zombies. I really like their look and demeanor. The C character looks a bit too cartoony and less serious.
1543,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Sports; Strategy; Arcade; Adventure; Action,,the style in option A fits my imagination for this type of game because she looks humanlike yet ready to defend against zombies
1544,Male,$31-60k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Strategy; Action; Adventure; Arcade; Role Playing,,"The crossbow and tan jacket in my top choice are rugged and compelling, which is appealing. Very cool design for sure!"
1545,Male,$61-100k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Strategy; Role Playing,,Choice A gits the theme of the story the best since the character looks determined and confident. Choice C looks too light hearted and happy go lucky which would be hard to do in a zombie apocalypse.
1546,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Sports; Racing; Arcade; Adventure; Action,,"My first choice appeared the most rugged and realistic to me. My last-ranked choice appeared the most cartoonish to me. While I do enjoy the aesthetic of my last-ranked choice, it did not seem realistic to me, and is not the image I had conjured up in my mind."
1547,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,45-54,Action; Adventure; Casino; Arcade; Sports,,"Option A would be my top choice because the character is more serious and focused. The art style is sharp, clear, and fits the overall role better than the other two options. Option C is way too comical in expression for the stated theme."
1548,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Role Playing; Strategy,,"I prefer the option A game character design style because I like the more realistic artwork and the facial expression of this character the most because she looks determined, strong and ready to fight those zombie monsters. I chose option B second because this game character design style looks less realistic and the character is too skinny and does not look very strong in comparison. I chose option C last because I do not like this more fanciful style with the unrealistic color palette and smile because this character should be more serious and determined to fight the zombies and not laughing or happy like this option C character design style shows."
1549,Male,$31-60k,Asian,Graduate Degree,25-34,Racing; Puzzle; Arcade; Adventure; Action,,doing job with joy and healthy diet definitely improve the performance / healthy diet ever improve the focus and stamina to perform the job better / fear and restless working reduce the performance
1550,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Puzzle; Strategy,,"I like option A better because it looks the most realistic and thus, believable."
1551,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Adventure; Arcade; Card; Racing; Action,,"I like B and A the most by far. I think they show off a realistic person that actually looks like they are in the aforementioned situation. I think their outfits and general design both look amazing. I think C is almost a little too cartoonish, I don__ think it fits the theme well at all in my opinion."
1552,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Racing; Arcade; Board; Adventure; Action,,This is my favorite because her look is that of someone who once led a normal peaceful life but because of what is going on in her new world she's been forced to be a warrior and is now battle tested and tough in a way she wasn't before.
1553,Male,$31-60k,Hispanic,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Adventure; Arcade; Action,,"The girl looks more realistic to be in the setting, and also cuter, which helps more and makes you feel for her and sympathize more with her."
1554,Female,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,Role Playing; Racing; Arcade; Adventure; Action,,This one definitely does. This one looks tough and cool. It fits the description the best. I would definitely want to be this zombie. It caught my attention right away. Thank you.
1555,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,25-34,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Racing; Simulation,,I love option A the most because she is the coolest looking character as well as looking the most badass and ready to fight off the zombies.
1556,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Sports; Adventure; Role Playing; Action; Arcade,,"I went in order of most realistic to cartoons, a zombie game should be realistic in my opinion"
1557,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Card; Puzzle; Action; Adventure; Arcade,,"A long coat, serious look, this is not funny. That is my approach. B was okay, but not serious enough to me. C hated it, laughing, smiling, no this is not my style in a zombie wasteland. I prefer a serious mood to it."
1558,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Sports; Role Playing; Arcade; Adventure; Action,,"Option B has the most appealing look, and design overall. The character has a unique look, fitting the mold of what I would expect in a zombie type of story. The character is detailed, conveys emotion from their facial features, and the artistic design has almost a comic type of look."
1559,Female,$0-30k,White,High School,55-64,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Family; Puzzle,,Choice A has the attitude and the weapon. Plainly see the correct army green shirt and dog tags along with the proper stance to fire the weapon with deadly accuracy. Choice B has an outfit to allow free movement but can see a wound maybe zombie related although she has a look in her eye that means business. Choice C has a cartoon feel in the face and posture but might be a quicker avatar with fluid movement and accuracy and maybe a secret weapon or skill.
1560,Male,$31-60k,Black,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Simulation; Strategy; Arcade; Adventure; Action,,Option A seems to have the look of worry. You can tell they are in dangerous situations. It shows the struggle. Option B looks more like for fun or just because.
1561,Male,$0-30k,White,High School,35-44,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Role Playing; Puzzle,,"Zombie games that are cute, like C, always seemed a bit off to me with a few notable exceptions (plants vs zombies), so I'm rather unnerved with C unless you're leaning greatly into the humor of the theme. Since the prompt doesn't sound like that, that is last place. B looks better to me, it is a bit low poly which gives a more crude look, which works well for the theme. Even if it makes the character a bit... pointy in  some places. Not a bad look and works for devices that can't handle a more realistic look. I would round out her chest a bit more, those things look like they can take an eye out. A looks about what I would expect from the theme. A dirty, hardened fighter. That doesn't mean that she can't show a softer side, but it takes a certain something to survive the world in that state. Also, I would like to think her apple, from B and C, is safely in a pocket for later."
1562,Male,$0-30k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Board; Card,,I find option A is authentic. I prefer this because it is eye-catching.
1563,Male,$101k+,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Arcade; Action; Adventure,,Option a looks the most realistic and not cartoonish. I would expect these characters to have a weapon that they were able to find in use on short notice. Their clothing also seems to fit this scenario.
1564,Male,$0-30k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Role Playing; Strategy,,Option A looks more human like and less digital alteration.
1565,Male,$61-100k,Asian,Graduate Degree,25-34,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Racing; Sports,,I ranked the designs and style of the female character for a zombie game that I liked the most.  I liked how fierce the character looked in option A followed by the facial features of option B and option C looked too cartoonish.
1566,Male,$61-100k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Adventure; Arcade,,"In a zombie apocalypse game, I would go with the art style in A, followed by B. I do not really care for C at all. I chose A/B because both have a gritty, more realistic presentation, and I prefer that graphic style over a more cartoony approach when it comes to this type of game. I think this would also make the gameplay look better, esp. when it came to violent animations."
1567,Male,$0-30k,White,High School,35-44,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Role Playing; Racing,,"B has a great style and tone. She looks ready ti kick butt and has a unique style. A isn't bad either, but C is too cartoony."
1568,Female,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Family; Arcade; Adventure; Action,,"Option A fits perfectly as the emotion shown by the warrior shows how serious the fight is, because there is no way one would be faced with a zombie rampage and have any reason to smile or laugh about the struggle to survive as portrayed by the other design."
1569,Male,$0-30k,White,High School,25-34,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Music; Puzzle,,I picked C and B as my top choices as the designs of the girl looks very engaging and they make it feel like they make the game very enjoyable to play.
1570,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Strategy; Word,,"Option a is the best because she actually has two hands on her crossbow, c is my last choice because she's just trying to stand very cute"
1571,Male,$0-30k,Black,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Role Playing; Strategy,,The art style in Option A is a little bit more rooted in reality
1572,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Casino,,Option a looks like someone beaten down and fighting for something. Options b and c look too calm and happy to have been fighting waves of zombies
1573,Female,$31-60k,Hispanic,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Board,,"A looked the most tough, like a low rent Lara Croft meets Katniss Everdeen. She looks like someone who has seen some scary things and is slightly traumatized but still carries on. Same for B but I can't see anyone wearing shorts in a zombie apocalypse. Feels way too impractical. C just looked way too chipper and jaunty for the new scary world"
1574,Male,$31-60k,White,Associate Degree,35-44,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Puzzle; Role Playing,,I like them all but I think Option B fits best with it being a game but also having a bit of a realistic look to it. I think with the super realistic option A doesn't grab people's attention as much as it kind of comes off looking like a lot of things out there. The third option is awesome and excellent render but I don't think it fits with the grit of the situation.
1575,Male,$0-30k,Hispanic,Associate Degree,21-24,Simulation; Strategy; Arcade; Adventure; Action,,I think the first two fit the theme the best. The third doesn't fit too well in my opinion. I like my first choice because I think it's stylish and sticks out from the generic realistic characters that are so often used. I think my first choice would look the most interesting and make the game feel more unique.
1576,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,35-44,Casino; Adventure; Arcade; Action; Role Playing,,"She looks more mature and battle hardened against the zombie hordes, experienced"
1577,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Arcade; Action; Adventure,,"I like Option A the best because it's the most realistic and gritty.  That's what I think of when I think of zombie apocalypses.  They're brutal and gritty and not flippant.  Option B isn't bad but it feels too clean, too much like an anime or something, that isn't necessarily related to zombies.  It sort of could be about anything.  Option C I'm torn on.  On one hand, it's my least favorite because it almost looks like it's from Disney or something, like Snow White, which totally doesn't fit my expectations of a zombie game.  On the other hand, if the game is satirical or sardonic or intentionally mocking that, or just using it as a contrast between the violence and ugliness of the zombies and  the Disney-esque graphical style, that could be really cool.  I guess think Borderlands or maybe even Bioshock.  So I'm very ambivalent about Option C.  For that one it really depends on what the overall feel of the game is.  If the game is very serious about its zombie apocalypse, then the graphics don't fit.  But if it's a twisted take, then it could be extremely cool."
1578,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,25-34,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Board; Card,,"Choice A because you have to keep your legs protected, zombies don't stop a sunburn. Choice B second because the last choice looks to much like an elf for my style."
1579,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Adventure; Action; Arcade,,"I feel like Choice B has the perfect balance of rugged and approachable. Players want a character that can complete the missions with strength and agility, but are not too hard to relate to at the same time."
1580,Male,$0-30k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Action; Adventure; Strategy; Arcade; Sports,,"I choose A, Because this styles really suites me it's more realistic and it is very trend today which every year they always upgrade the style and it really suites well."
1581,Male,$0-30k,Black,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Role Playing; Puzzle; Arcade; Adventure; Action,,"I chose Option A because the woman's design fits the dark and serious tone the most. The other two are fine, but are a little too cartoony."
1582,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Simulation; Racing; Arcade; Adventure; Action,,Option A perfectly fit with my imagination. It was armed good
1583,Male,$0-30k,Asian,Associate Degree,25-34,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Role Playing; Simulation,,I chose Option A because it seems to be the most realistic. The character looks like she's been through a lot of struggles because of the zombie invasion.
1584,Male,$0-30k,White,High School,25-34,Role Playing; Board; Arcade; Adventure; Action,,I voted option A the highest because I believe it fits the theme of a modern day zombie outbreak the best. Option A looks like they are better equipped and better protected that option B and option C.
1585,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Role Playing; Simulation,,Women would look more like Option A. They would have to be armed and dress themselves with anything they could find.
1586,Male,$31-60k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Board; Role Playing,,"A looks like she has seen some stuff and is toughened by her world. Looks like a hunter, someone struggling. B also looks like that, but more defeated in her expressions. C is just to jovial and fun to fit this description"
1587,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,21-24,Action; Arcade; Adventure; Puzzle; Word,,"I ranked them based on how generally realistic and disheveled the characters look, only because that's how someone would most accurately look in a situation like that. If they're all clean and sparkly (and cartoon-y) then it doesn't fit as well as if they looked human and in human condition."
1588,Female,$0-30k,Black,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Strategy; Trivia,,The more clothing the better. All the more places to hide essential supplies and weapons
1589,Female,$0-30k,White,High School,25-34,Role Playing; Simulation; Arcade; Adventure; Action,,"A looks like the most battle hardened of the 3, C is if you'd somehow turned it into a super kid friendly version and B looks better than C except for her face. I don't know what kind of weird Mona Lisa smile she has going on, but it detracts from a stoic hero archetype."
1590,Male,$31-60k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Role Playing; Strategy,,I prefer the character in option B because she feels the most interesting and capable of defeating zombies. Option C and A do not spark my imagination as much!
1591,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Role Playing; Simulation,,"I like this art style the most. It's realistic without being too boring. The character looks somewhat tough and strong. Her clothing and weapon look somewhat worn, like she's seen some things."
1592,Male,$61-100k,Black,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Sports,,You must be ready to defend at any time and the 3rd option doesn't look ready.
1593,Male,$0-30k,White,High School,35-44,Sports; Arcade; Adventure; Action,,"In this hypothetical scenario, there is a zombie invasion in 2020, and humans are both fleeing from zombies and fighting them off to save their lives. Character A best embodies the type of person I imagine to be fighting off the zombies, as the girl looks much more rugged and less dolled-up than the other two. Also, she is wearing more generic, battle-worn clothing that I'd imagine someone who's been fleeing, hiding, and fighting would be wearing. Character B somewhat fits the style I'd imagine, as the girl is holding a crossbow, which would be a suitable weapon against zombies, but she's also wearing a fitted, stylish sportscoat and mini-skirt, which looks more appropriate for wearing around the mall than in a zombie apocalypse. The apple she is holding is a nice touch, though, and I wouldn't mind seeing that incorporated into the design of Character A. Character C least looks like a woman fleeing a zombie invasion because she looks more like an illustration than a real human, and she is smiling, while the other two have grim, smug looks on their faces. I wouldn't expect to see someone staving off zombies to be smiling."
1594,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,65+,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Puzzle; Simulation,,I fully like the first one just as like the charectr in terminator. the third is just too silly
1595,Male,$31-60k,White,Graduate Degree,45-54,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Trivia; Educational,,"To realistically be able to face off with zombies, you need a human character that exhibits confidence enough to stand a chance of survival and only Option A does that here. Those hands are solidly on the crossbow and the character meets us with a stern gaze."
1596,Male,$61-100k,White,High School,35-44,Puzzle; Action; Adventure; Arcade; Strategy,,"C looks the most imaginative and fun which is how I usually imagine things, followed by B. A looks a little too realistic."
1597,Male,$61-100k,Black,Associate Degree,25-34,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Puzzle; Role Playing,,"I like the shadow and serious look on that girl's face in A. It goes along with the theme. In B, there's still a shadow and a serious look but I think it's less serious and the more cartoon style kind of takes away from the seriousness of the drastic change and zombie aspect. C just looks cartoonish and out of place with this concept altogether."
1598,Male,$101k+,Black,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Role Playing,,Option B gives just the right amount of rugged with animated character features. Option A looks boring and option C is too cartoonish.
1599,Male,$0-30k,White,High School,25-34,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Music; Role Playing,,"I picked my number 1 based on how ""hard"" she looks the stern look on her face and the way she holds the weapon look intimidating, option B is less so because she isn't looking straight forward, and option C just looks like a generic cartoon style, no intimidation or interest at all."
1600,Female,$31-60k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Role Playing; Strategy,,"If I were trying to live through a zombie outbreak, option B was what I had in mind.  Maybe a gun or both, combined it great, and more relaxed than ready to super kill things.  Hence, option B was my first choice, not too ""bad ass"" and not too soft like option C.  Next was option B, again, if it were a zombie outbreak, I would be prepared to kill them - hence the stern look is more to my tastes than in my last choice (like option C - which just looks fun, and nothing would be fun about any of this)."
1601,Male,$61-100k,Black,High School,25-34,Sports; Racing; Arcade; Adventure; Action,,"Option A seem like she's ready to take on a wave of zombies based on her stance and rough jacket and ready face. Option B is more of a cleaner and timid look with apple in her hand and pig tails in her hair. Looks kind of weak to me. Option C looks like a psychopath, kind of remind me of Joker assistance in Batmen. She seem more of a dark humor character."
1602,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,35-44,Role Playing; Board; Arcade; Adventure; Action,,"Option A is my first choice because she looks the most realistic.  When I think of zombie related entertainment, more realistic imagery comes to my mind.  Option B is a good art style, so I ranked it 2nd.  Option B could work for a zombie game, but she looks a little too cute to be running around fighting zombies in that outfit.  I don't like the art style of Option C at all, but it could work for a lighthearted zombie game."
1603,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,21-24,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Strategy; Role Playing,,"Option A is definitely my preference here. Having watched many zombie post-apocalyptic films and shows like The Walking Dead, World War Z and 28 Days Later, survivors would probably adopt an outfit that offers protection and not use any bright colors. It's realistic that survivors would wear anyhting they can find in plain colors like a brown trench coat and black/grey/brown on the rest of their clothing. Options B and C are not my style because the character look almost cartoonish and it isn't realistic that females would wear such modern clothing in a survival situation when you need to be covered to survive and also avoid getting cuts/injuries which can kill you without antibiotics. I also love the crossbow in all 3 styles since that is probably one of the most efficient weapons you can use in a zombie apocalypse."
1604,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Strategy; Role Playing,,I like the more realistic design. It is more gritty and looks better than the cartoon style. Option C looks like it would be from a kid's game.
1605,Female,$31-60k,White,Vocational Training,25-34,Adventure; Action; Role Playing; Arcade; Simulation,,"I feel like people would be carrying around guns, looking all beat up like they been through something,"
1606,Male,$61-100k,Hispanic,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Adventure; Puzzle; Action; Strategy; Arcade,,B to me looks like Buffy the vampire slayer and quite well drawn
1607,Male,$61-100k,Hispanic,High School,35-44,Puzzle; Role Playing; Arcade; Adventure; Action,,I Chose option A first because according to the description it seems like the first choice would be a better fit and the graphics and the character seem more realistic. The second choice seemed a little light hearted but the characters still seems somewhat realistic. The last choice didn't seem to fit because it is a little too animated and cartoon like.
1608,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,45-54,Puzzle; Trivia; Action; Adventure; Arcade,,"Practical, and realistic as well as ready for anything.  I love the long coat and crossbow."
1609,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,35-44,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Role Playing; Strategy,,"the woman looks serious, that is, with an attitude and with a dress according to the apocalyptic situation"
1610,Male,$0-30k,Black,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Role Playing; Arcade; Adventure; Action,,"Option A fits my imagination the most. From what I see in the image, it looks rugged, rough, and aggressive. I imagine in a zombie outbreak, this is what would become of most remaining humans. The other characters seem a bit too clean, and happy about the situation so I think of them less when I hear zombies."
1611,Male,$0-30k,Hispanic,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Card; Role Playing,,I really like C the best as I think its very different and unique. It has a fun feel while also still feeling like they could really be in the scenario described.
1612,Male,$0-30k,White,High School,25-34,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Role Playing,,I feel like choice a is a better representation of what a zombie survival would be like. the other two look like they should be in a movie.
1613,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,45-54,Puzzle; Sports; Arcade; Adventure; Action,,The A style has the best and boldest outlook.
1614,Female,$0-30k,White,Associate Degree,25-34,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Music; Puzzle,,"'A' is the only one that fits with this description.  Serious look, ready to fight.  'B' and 'C' don't give the feeling of struggle against attack.  I don't like the animated goofy look on 'C' either."
1615,Male,$0-30k,Other,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Role Playing; Puzzle,,It all depends on the tone of the game. A is the best because it is the most serious. B is semi serious and semi cute. C is cute which would be fine if the game is not so serious and it good fun. Like I would never recommend C in a super serious game or a game where there is little in the way of jokes and humor.
1616,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,Arcade; Adventure; Action,,These style best matches my taste and overall sense of imagination
1617,Female,$31-60k,Hispanic,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Arcade; Card; Puzzle; Action; Adventure,,"I would definitely need both hands to hold that cross bow! A and B she looks more like a realistic character, she looks a bit cartoony in C."
1618,Male,$0-30k,Black,High School,25-34,Role Playing; Board; Arcade; Adventure; Action,,"C looks the most gritty and interesting. A is a close second , and preferably I do like the design and it's technically more unique than A just not as gritty and fitting overall. B looks way to light and kind , I don't sense dread."
1619,Male,$0-30k,Hispanic,Less than High School Diploma,25-34,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Role Playing; Simulation,,"I chose B first because its the most run down and sad one as i feel someone who would be fighting the entire time would be like this, A is next because its serious and ready to do battle and C is last because i dont see anyone smiling while having to deal with life or death."
1620,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Simulation; Arcade; Adventure; Action,,"I'm going to start with why I chose this one first. Despite all odds, the protagonist here looks optimistic and hopeful, and that's what I want to see in a protagonist. I went with  A next because even though she's not quite so optimistic as it were, she still seems determined to get things done that need doing. Lastly, B went because she looks downright miserable and I'm trying to escape reality, not recreate it, you know?"
1621,Male,$31-60k,Asian,Graduate Degree,25-34,Action; Adventure; Arcade,,"A looks like the best fighter to survive the zombies. The style of B is also good, but she looks more like someone you would protect. C is too cartoony."
1622,Female,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,55-64,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Strategy; Puzzle,,"I chose A  for the style that fits my imagination if a large number of zombies encroach on human existence.Humans retreat again and again, gathered to establish multiple shelters, struggling against the waves of zombies.  I think choice A looks fierce like she could take them on. She also looks smart and calm..fearless, ready and prepared."
1623,Male,$61-100k,White,Associate Degree,55-64,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Strategy; Sports,,"The 1st chosen depict what is to be engaged from Humans, a better representation of fierce fighting preparedness"
1624,Male,$0-30k,White,High School,35-44,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Strategy; Sports,,I really like the art style of options A and B with Option A being my favorite. Option C also looks pretty cool but for some reason it reminds me of a character from the video game fortnite. I really like the character stance and demeanor of option A the best as they look like they are ready to go to battle as the others look a bit more relaxed. However I do wonder what the circular object that both option B and C are holding as the character in option A isnt holding it. Very cool art design though for all three character models.
1625,Male,$0-30k,White,High School,21-24,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Puzzle; Card,,"I like option A because she feels very rugged and realistic. Cartoon zombies aren't as scary as realistic ones, so I think it's important for the protagonist to match that feel. B is a cool art style, but I feel like it's missing something. A feels too much like a Disney character and zombies + Disney is gimmicky."
1626,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,25-34,Strategy; Arcade; Adventure; Action,,"My rankings are in order of how realistic the characters look given to l the scenario explained. I also considered sex appeal and felt it best if the primary choice was less sexy or playful. My A ranking image looks like a hardened survivor, whereas choice b and c get more playful and less serious."
1627,Male,$101k+,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Trivia; Puzzle; Arcade; Adventure; Action,,"I prefer realism in zombie games for some reason. A looks the most realistic, then B, and C looks like a cartoon, not very mature."
1628,Male,$31-60k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Adventure; Puzzle; Action; Arcade; Sports,,"For such a serious topic, Option A felt the most realistic looking. Option C felt too cartoonish and didn't match the serious tone of the struggle against the zombies. Option B would be my second choice because it still keeps a realistic look and only has a slightly cartoonish vibe to it. Also, with Option A, the weapon is the most visible, helping to emphasize the action role of the character."
1629,Female,$31-60k,White,Graduate Degree,55-64,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Card; Trivia,,I definitely chose A as the first choice because you would need to be fierce.  I chose C as last because that person looks like they do not have a clue.
1630,Female,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Role Playing; Word; Adventure; Arcade; Action,,"B appeals to me firstly, because although she looks timid she is holding a powerful weapon and what appears to be food. It gives me the idea that she worked hard to obtain that food. A comes in next for me. She looks stern and powerful, like she is ready to go out and kick butt. C looks funky to me. The character looks mousy and oddly animated. She looks like a villain in a vampire cartoon or something similar from Pixar."
1631,Male,$31-60k,Black,High School,25-34,Simulation; Strategy; Arcade; Adventure; Action,,"Option A lookes, rugged, determined, and like she has been through a lot to get to where she is. Option B also looks battle hardened but less so.  Option C looks way to happy to be in a zombie apocalypse."
1632,Female,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,21-24,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Casino; Strategy,,"I chose Optio. A first because I like how rugged her clothes are, and how she is fully covered because clothing kind of serves as a protective barrier (sometimes just symbolically) against things going on around you. I think she looks worn down enough to be believable while still looking very pretty. I chose Option C last because I think she looks too much like a princess-y style cartoon. I don't like how shes wearing short shorts and standing in kind of a provocative way, and I dont understand the significance of her holding the apple"
1633,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,35-44,Strategy; Action; Adventure; Arcade; Puzzle,,Option A looks more dark and gritty. I think that fits the theme of a zombie apocalypse the best. The character looks like she has been through some tough times and is more sympathetic.
1634,Female,$101k+,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Arcade; Action; Adventure; Puzzle; Music,,Option C is more cartoony and has a fun art style.  Option A looks more rugged.  Option B__ skirt shows too much leg.
1635,Male,$31-60k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,Simulation; Role Playing; Arcade; Adventure; Action,,Option A looks the most realistic to me in the situation described. I ranked them from most realistic to most cartoonish. Option C shows the character smiling which is not in line with the description.
1636,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,21-24,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Racing; Role Playing,,Option A looks like someone who would be able to fight off zombies without a problem. They look ready for battle and have the necessary equipment to survive. Option B is next because she looks determined but the bow is not in a ready position and not as prepared to fight. C is final because the character looks more fun and caring rather than determined to fight zombies.
1637,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Puzzle; Strategy,,"Option A looks the more rugged and realistic, showing that the humans are struggling. Option B shows that slightly while option C is too happy and looks like they are eating an apple which would be hard to find in a zombie infested world."
1638,Male,$0-30k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Simulation; Adventure; Arcade; Role Playing; Action,,B looks like she's struggling the most and having a hard time. A looks sad and a little dirty but not as much as B. C looks too much like she's enjoying herself though the art style is nice.
1639,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,Simulation; Role Playing; Arcade; Adventure; Action,,"Option A is the most realistic depiction I would expect from a zombie apocalypse type game. She looks weathered and I just love the crossbow. Option B is good too, just a tad too cartoonish. Option C, the character is way too happy for the scenario."
1640,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Board; Sports,,Option A firs well with the given description. This image is powerful and intense.
1641,Female,$101k+,White,Associate Degree,25-34,Action; Adventure; Arcade,,"Option A - because she has a fierce look about her, her expression, the way she is holding her weapon. The other girls look like they could get eaten by a zombie at any minute"
1642,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Trivia; Card; Casino; Sports,,I don't think it's super original but I do like the mushrooms and the little sea creatures. It kind of gives me a star craft vibe of building for war looks interesting and fun
1643,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,Family; Puzzle; Action; Role Playing; Strategy,,"The colors are richer than I would have expected, the unclear gameplay detracts some. It is certainly a game but I am unsure how it is meant to be played."
1644,Male,$0-30k,White,High School,25-34,Action; Adventure; Puzzle; Word; Music,,"I find the overall concept very appealing, I like the can of soda in the water, as well as the details in the lily pads and grass. I like the appearance of the insects and the mushrooms. It all looks very appealing to me and it makes me very interested."
1645,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,25-34,Action; Adventure; Strategy; Puzzle; Sports,,I do really like the overall aesthetic of the game. I find that having sort of city builder in a bug realm would be very interesting. The type of gameplay I would be looking forward to is upgrading my base and the potential battles.
1646,Male,$0-30k,White,High School,25-34,Adventure; Arcade; Role Playing; Strategy; Simulation,,The UI seems very clean and spacious.
1647,Male,$0-30k,Hispanic,Less than High School Diploma,25-34,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Role Playing; Simulation,,I love the way it looks it almost feels like a real landscape its very detailed and i love the random trash everywhere it adds a ton of character to the design.
1648,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Casino; Puzzle; Trivia,,I like that it is tiled and I would assume objects are restricted to moving a certain amount of tiles. I think that adds to the strategy of the game and makes it interesting. I don't really understand if the main goal is building or to attack others in this game. There are elements of both and its hard to see what the gameplay is like just based on this image. I like the mushrooms being used as buildings.
1649,Male,$31-60k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Role Playing; Simulation; Strategy; Arcade; Adventure,,"The mushroom characters seems to be very much attractive and has good looking coca cola cans , everything in the picture seems to be realistic"
1650,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Role Playing; Strategy,,"I like the concept because I think it would be attractive to play as insect like bees and ants trying to forage for food in a human park or city. I find the gold, metal and wood icons to be very useful in directing attention to the resources one can find in this game. I look forward to being able to walk on land rather than water in this game."
1651,Male,$101k+,White,High School,25-34,Strategy; Action; Adventure; Role Playing; Puzzle,,I find this very attractive to look at. I like the environment and the vibe it gives off. The serene feeling of being around water and plant life is what I'm getting and I like the mushrooms to. I don't like the Coke product placement though.
1652,Male,$0-30k,White,High School,25-34,Card; Strategy; Puzzle; Word; Sports,,"I think the setting is visually attractive. The prominence of the light blue, green, and red colors are eye-catching but also relaxing. In terms of the elements of the gameplay I'm expecting, I can tell it's a game where you collect materials and build and level up different structures, with the option of microtransactions to speed up your progress. I personally find games like these ubiquitous and too similar to one another -- they ultimately become too much of a grind, so I wouldn't choose to play this game myself."
1653,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Adventure; Strategy; Role Playing,,"It's hard to tell, but this looks like the gameplay would be a standard strategy/war gather resources and build a kingdom type or game.  the art style is nice and cute, but if the gameplay isn't interesting then than doesn't matter to me."
1654,Male,$61-100k,Hispanic,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Strategy; Sports; Action; Role Playing; Racing,,"I personally dont find the setting to be very attractive. However, I love the detail that is used. I like that you have good 3D imagery with excellent detail to them. So for me the concept was not good, but the execution of it was outstanding."
1655,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,25-34,Action; Casino; Arcade; Trivia,,"Everything looks fine, I like the idea of a strategy game set in a pond, using frogs as soldiers. I am really thrown off by the blatant advertising of a coke can on the shorline."
1656,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Adventure; Casino; Music; Sports,,This is very engaging to me because of the high level of detail and the bright and bold colors and overall design.  I would look forward to a very challenging game that would test my skills on several levels.
1657,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Puzzle; Sports; Strategy,,"I'm not really a fan of the swamp theme because I find the bugs and murky water pretty disgusting in real life.  I also don't like that there is garbage in the water, unless the them is to clean up the swamp."
1658,Male,$31-60k,Black,Associate Degree,25-34,Music; Family; Casino; Board,,I like the color of the plot and the settings
1659,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Sports; Strategy; Arcade; Adventure; Action,,i think the gameplay design looks attractive because the 3d looks realistic and pleasant
1660,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,Card; Board; Racing; Puzzle; Adventure,,A great story concept will make a good gameplay structure. Story and gameplay are both vital for having a great game. Video games are fun because they transport us to a new realities. That will satisfy our needs of achievements and recognition. This Video will keep us interested.
1661,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Adventure; Puzzle; Role Playing; Strategy,,I think this is very attractive. It reminds me of the smurfs cartoons.  I like the floating coke can that gives size reference.  THat is a nice touch.
1662,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,35-44,Simulation; Puzzle; Card; Board; Adventure,,I like the graphics but would like to see different structures other than just the same type of mushroom
1663,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Trivia; Puzzle; Educational; Board; Action,,I particularly like the bright colors on it I think the picture itself is very inviting the bright colors make use of the darker colors that produce negative space though
1664,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Strategy; Puzzle; Adventure,,I think it looks great and is very detailed. I like the water and items in it as well as th coke can floating.
1665,Male,$61-100k,Other,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Adventure,,"The picture is somewhat attractive, but not overly. The game feels a little outdated to me and i would not be all that excited to play. I would be more interested in a role playing game instead of one where i am just overseeing what happens."
1666,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,35-44,Action; Adventure; Role Playing; Simulation; Strategy,,"looks very nice and has a fantastic pseudo realism that I like , it looks like a leaf can be used as  a raft and maybe trash can be salvaged ad used. if that is correct those are fun mechanics I feel s exploration is a big draw for me to games (explore to find items to build things, etc)"
1667,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,25-34,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Racing; Simulation,,I find this to be incredibly attractive. I love the water surrounding the game area. I love the design of the red mushrooms. It looks very fun to play.
1668,Male,$61-100k,Hispanic,Graduate Degree,45-54,Arcade; Sports; Card; Puzzle,,The game appears to be about insects of some kind.  I think the overall style is visually appealing.  Just not sure what the gameplay will like.  It seems like the game could be a little slow speed and not my type of game.  Hard to tell without a description of the gameplay.
1669,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Casino; Adventure; Strategy,,The color scheme is bright and aesthetic while the shadowing is just enough to provide a good range of depth on one image
1670,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Trivia; Strategy,,"I think it looks a little better than average for a game like this.  The quality is actually good, but the style is kind of generic"
1671,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Sports,,I think that the concept shown in the picture is pretty attractive and seems like it would make for a fun little build and resource collecting/managing game. I like the idea of building up a little colony for different bugs to live in. It is something different in that regard since it is not human centric. I like the look of the game a lot and how colorful it it. I like how the water looks and the cans in it to make it really feel like you are a bug. The UI of the game seems pretty solid as well. I like the different bug types and think that would be fun.
1672,Male,$101k+,White,Graduate Degree,25-34,Card; Role Playing; Strategy; Sports; Casino,,"I like the concept that is presented in the image. It's very clear to me this is a type of game where you collect resources and fight off enemies. I like the touches of realism shown in the pond/swamp, and I like the extras included like the cup and can of pop in the bottom corners of the screen. I don't immediately jump at playing these types of games, but the concept provided here would make me interested in trying it out."
1673,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Word; Puzzle; Strategy; Adventure; Action,,"it is fine, i think some of the smaller details stand out too much, they almost look too well done compared to the gaming board you play off of, the contrast is too much, but i like the mushrooms and bug idea,"
1674,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Adventure; Puzzle; Racing; Role Playing; Simulation,,"I think that this is a great 3D design.  The game board is not too cluttered, and there are not too many side icons. The fonts are not too small on the top."
1675,Male,$61-100k,Asian,Graduate Degree,25-34,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Racing; Sports,,This looks like the type of mobile game that I would like to play.  I just hope there are no ads.
1676,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Simulation; Action; Family; Strategy; Racing,,I don't think this is a game I would want to play.  I'm confused on where to even begin based on the screen shot provided.
1677,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Adventure; Puzzle; Card; Action; Strategy,,The game looks interesting except for the upgrade with 3d timer on it.  I've played these games before and they set really long timers and let you skip them for money.  For that I'd rather play a good game.  I assume its a city/civilization building game?  Looks like you can fight with others judging by the sword icon.
1678,Male,$31-60k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Strategy; Action; Adventure; Arcade; Role Playing,,"I like the design! The bright green grass and red mushrooms are fun and caught my eye. It looks like some sort of strategy game, which I always find fun and intriguing. Very cool for sure!"
1679,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,Music; Strategy; Word,,"It is Ok, but nothing grand. Gaming has veered toward such lifelike imagery that this almost looks nostalgic. That said, I am not following the product placement of the Coke can. That seems borderline bizarre. I do like the greenery -- that adds a hint of vivid color."
1680,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Board; Simulation; Strategy; Puzzle; Role Playing,,"I like it a lot. I love that art style because it is not super serious or realistic, I prefer it that way"
1681,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Adventure; Action,,"I really like the colors and design of the game. The Coke can and other trash is a nice touch, but kind of depressing. I'm also concerned about licensing, since that's so clearly a Coke can."
1682,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Strategy; Simulation,,"I think the game potentially could be interesting, it seems fun to be on a pond and get to build up your land/house with bugs and other nature being in the way. I would have to see how the game progresses with challenges, depending on the obstacles I could see the game getting boring at times. Or on the opposite end it may be so chaotic you never have a chance to relax."
1683,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Strategy; Word,,"I don't really like that there is a floating Coca-Cola can, but I think that game looks like a fun strategy game that it would not take too long to learn"
1684,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,35-44,Casino; Adventure; Arcade; Action; Role Playing,,"I like the overall theme of the backyard look, reminds me of honey I shrunk the kids, plus the bugs and shroom homes look fun to build, I would be interested in trying this out.  Only thing that I don't like is that it looks like it has some sort of pay function with VIP."
1685,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Role Playing; Simulation; Strategy; Sports; Action,,"I think the mushrooms and lily pads are interesting. However, I am not a big fan of bugs, so that turns me off a little. The coca cola can is a great touch though. Not sure the object of the game, it appearing you may build things."
1686,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Sports; Adventure; Strategy; Role Playing,,"I do not like anything about this concept. Firstly, I think the grass textures look abysmal and are not helped by trying to identify tiles perhaps via the edges. I do not understand the random junk in the water even though I get that the concept is probably something to do with bug and animal life where trash in the water would be realistic. This is a game however and that choice is just bizarre. I also think the interface is too busy with too many icons - I can't tell if there is some RTTS resource gathering, crafting, or something else going on and it's also hard to tell whether or not these bugs are units, NPCs, or enemies. I assume there is some kind of base-building and that is what I would look most forward to overall."
1687,Male,$101k+,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Puzzle; Board; Card; Strategy; Trivia,,I think the rendering is definitely attractive. The nature elements in the image are beautifully rendered. I'm interested to know what the mushroom houses(?) are for and why there is a Coke can in the lower right hand corner.
1688,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Adventure; Strategy; Role Playing; Simulation,,I love how sharp the image is. I like the coke can and the mushrooms. The building area looks great as well.
1689,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Word,,I like it - the graphics look good and it's an interesting concept.  Seems to be some tile-moving game/world-building game.  It's worth a look at in my opinion.
1690,Male,$101k+,Asian,Graduate Degree,45-54,Action; Arcade; Casino; Racing; Simulation,,It looks somewhat intriguing and it looks like a good mix of realism and cartoons
1691,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Board; Card; Racing; Puzzle,,"I like the graphics and I think the colors are very vibrant and beautiful, so I would give it a 4."
1692,Male,$61-100k,Other,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Adventure,,"I most prefer the construction man because the guy is really relatable looking, and the doctor because she is attractive and has cool weapons."
1693,Male,$0-30k,White,High School,25-34,Action; Adventure; Puzzle; Word; Music,,"1, I find the construction worker to be a very unique and interesting character, not something I usually see in games, this makes me very interested.2, I find the character looks interesting with the vest and the radio, and is slightly attractive with the vest and vivid hair."
1694,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Arcade; Casino; Puzzle; Sports; Word,,"The two women look the most dangerous, bad ass, and attractive."
1695,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Sports; Strategy; Arcade; Adventure; Action,,i like these two characters because of their futuristic yet realistic looks to them
1696,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Role Playing; Strategy,,"I like the shovel wielding blue woman wearing the scientific coat the most because she looks very smart and powerful. I also like the smaller cat lady wielding the two samurai swords because she looks very dynamic, quick and agile, and I like the cute cat character near her feet a lot too."
1697,Male,$0-30k,Hispanic,Less than High School Diploma,25-34,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Role Playing; Simulation,,1 is good because i love swordsman characters best as they are very fun to play. 2 is also good because the sniper looks like shes rough and accurate and ready to camp and shoot all day.
1698,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,Puzzle; Action; Adventure; Strategy; Music,,"Being a big guy myself, we need a character to represent us."
1699,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Sports; Role Playing; Arcade; Adventure; Action,,"Both characters are unique, and have a natural personality to them. They are both colorful, and look visually detailed. I think they would be more memorable types of characters."
1700,Male,$61-100k,White,Vocational Training,25-34,Action; Adventure; Role Playing; Simulation,,All of these characters remind me of players on Team Fortreess Classic. I do like the Spec Ops girl with the yellow vest.
1701,Male,$61-100k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,21-24,Card; Strategy; Simulation; Adventure; Action,,"I would prefer these 2 characters because they look the coolest and most appealing. I think the weapon choice is really unique in where there are dual swords and a doctor has a shovel. It's funny but also very cool at the same time, these charcters would appeal to me the most."
1702,Male,$101k+,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Arcade; Casino; Card; Trivia; Role Playing,,Il ike the medical person using unconventional weapons and the traditional warrior
1703,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Racing; Arcade; Board; Adventure; Action,,I love the designs and got both characters have a very innocent but also sinister quality about them. It makes them believable.
1704,Male,$101k+,White,High School,35-44,Simulation; Strategy; Puzzle,,"The woman with the rifle looks like a sniper-type character, and I generally like ranged combat for strategy games.  The doctor might have some unique capabilities, and if she perished during game play we could just chalk it up to COVID."
1705,Male,$0-30k,White,Associate Degree,25-34,Simulation; Role Playing; Word; Adventure; Action,,I think they have very cool aesthetics
1706,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Adventure; Casino; Music; Sports,,I like these two characters the most for such a game concept because the are strong and tough and ready for action whenever needed plus I like their weapons and costumes since they are the most engaging.
1707,Male,$101k+,White,High School,25-34,Strategy; Action; Adventure; Role Playing; Puzzle,,The two characters in the middle I find to be pretty boring and uninspired. The characters on the far left and right look fun.
1708,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Casino; Puzzle; Trivia,,I like both the nurse and the construction guy because I feel them being dressed as their job gives them more of a backstory and you can see what they were doing before everything started to happen. I don't mind the katana girl or the other woman with the gun but they seem too generic and don't seem to have a story behind them.
1709,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Trivia; Card; Casino; Sports,,I like the little girl with swords. I think her cat is really neat. I also like the construction worker guy he has a really cool weapon
1710,Male,$61-100k,Hispanic,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Strategy; Sports; Action; Role Playing; Racing,,The reason why I picked these two characters is because of their weapons of choice. I think that they will come handy during any survival battles they have.
1711,Male,$0-30k,White,High School,35-44,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Role Playing; Puzzle,,"I tend to like big, slow burly characters so the construction guy with a crane hook looks like an interesting person to play as. The doctor with the spiked shovel makes me wonder about her backstory, which is worth a second click,. I do also wonder about the school girl with the swords and cat, but she feels really out of place."
1712,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Puzzle; Sports; Strategy,,"I like these two because they seem like they are just regular people, a doctor and construction worker, who picked up whatever was closest to them to use as a weapon when they saw zombies.  I like that they look like unlikely heroes."
1713,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Adventure; Strategy; Role Playing,,"The ninja kitten girl doesn't fit for me, and the other two are pretty plain.  The doctor is interesting though."
1714,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,Card; Board; Racing; Puzzle; Adventure,,"I choose two vital character , which are most important who risks their lives to protect peoples lives. So that , I prefer to choose those two optimistic characters. And they were well designed with outfits and accessories."
1715,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,25-34,Action; Casino; Arcade; Trivia,,"I am not a fan of the construction worker, he looks so boring to use, I think I would die if I tried to kill a zombie with a hook. I think that the faces of these characters all kind of look the same, these are not high quality characters."
1716,Male,$61-100k,Hispanic,Graduate Degree,45-54,Arcade; Sports; Card; Puzzle,,Of the four I would pick these two.  The 1st one reminds me of the main character from the movie Sucker Punch.  Looks like a younger girl so it's a character that you don't normally associate with violence.  Interested in see more about this character.  My 2nd choice is just the more interesting of the remaining three characters.  Just would want to see how that character moves and is used in the game.
1717,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,35-44,Simulation; Puzzle; Card; Board; Adventure,,They have the best weapons and look the most prepared to fight and survive
1718,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Adventure; Puzzle; Role Playing; Strategy,,My favorites are the construction worker and the nurse.  I like them because their jobs are  very relatable and you don't think of them as really being fighters.  I think it would be fun to play with them because you wouldn't expect it.
1719,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Trivia; Puzzle; Educational; Board; Action,,Go big or go small I think they're also the best drawn and look like they have the coolest sidekick and or weapon
1720,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Casino; Trivia; Word; Action; Arcade,,"with all 4 charachtes, I can see them in their previous self.  The friendly and strong construction worker, the pretty dr who's tryin to get through"

1722,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Casino; Adventure; Strategy,,Melee combat in zombie games is always the most fun and these characters give the best interpretation of who'd I'd like to see in a game like this
1723,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Simulation; Action; Family; Strategy; Racing,,"I really only liked the one character that I clicked.  As a male, I don't identify with any of the other characters."
1724,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,25-34,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Racing; Simulation,,I love these characters because they look amazing and seem like they would both be fun while providing me an advantage in the game.
1725,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Trivia; Strategy,,"I like playing as underdog characters, and think that these two would be fun to play as.  The character design is cool and I really like the cat sidekick"
1726,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Adventure; Puzzle; Racing; Role Playing; Simulation,,Character 1 is the only person with a gun - that would be useful against Zombies.  Option 4 has a shovel and looks ready for action.
1727,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Casino; Adventure; Racing; Sports; Word,,"These are the 2 figures that stand out to me the most, but I would probably not buy these figures because I am not much of a figure collector."
1728,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Adventure; Strategy; Role Playing; Simulation,,I like the construction worker. I feel like he looks normal and not weird like the others.
1729,Male,$61-100k,Asian,Graduate Degree,25-34,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Racing; Sports,,I clicked on the two characters that I would like to play as in the mobile game.  I liked the school girl with the two swords and the nurse with the shovel.
1730,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Sports,,There are the two characters I liked the best because they felt the most grounded and real to be while both being able to have a skill set that would make them really useful in a post-apocalyptic survival/zombie-themed strategy war game. I like the red headed cop because she looks really cool and badass. Her being a cop would give her some training and skill for this situation. I also like the massive gun that she has. The other character would be good to have around as a healer and caretaker since they are a doctor. I also like the modified shovel that she has as well.
1731,Male,$31-60k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Strategy; Action; Adventure; Arcade; Role Playing,,"The orange color scheme of my top choice is bright and attractive, and caught my eye. The blue color of my second choice is also nice, and the shovel she holds caught my eye. Overall it's a nice set of designs for sure!"
1732,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Adventure; Puzzle; Card; Action; Strategy,,This character at least is mostly covered up and protected from zombie bites.  Also she has a gun and a lot of equipment which I think would be more useful than a shovel or a sword.  You don't want to get too close to zombies.  The others look to silly.
1733,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,Music; Strategy; Word,,I find these female characters to be most compelling. I love that one is flanked by a black cat. And the other looks like a doomsday nurse!
1734,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Action; Arcade; Word,,I thought these two characters were more down to earth and every day people who had to evolve to survive.
1735,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Adventure; Action,,"The two characters I chose have the most effective weapons, but I'm not a fan of the art style"
1736,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Strategy; Simulation,,"The big construction guy looks like he could be a lot of fun to play as, I imagine he has some cool moves. The woman with the gun also looks interesting, depending on the zombies I could see her being very useful."
1737,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Board; Simulation; Strategy; Puzzle; Role Playing,,I like how exaggerated the size of the first guy is and I think the swords the second girl has are really cool
1738,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Strategy; Word,,"I think the girl can snipe people from a very long distance, and I think that the big tank kind of guy could draw people into combat"
1739,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,35-44,Casino; Adventure; Arcade; Action; Role Playing,,"Out of these, the construction guy would be my pick, hes the most relatable to me, the others are far distant second."
1740,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Role Playing; Simulation; Strategy; Sports; Action,,I think the construction worker would be interesting due to his size and weapon choice. It is unique. The policewoman looks like  good choice because of her effective weapon.
1741,Male,$101k+,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Puzzle; Board; Card; Strategy; Trivia,,"I'm interested the most in the construction worker - what his background is, how he fights and uses his weapons."
1742,Male,$61-100k,Other,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Adventure,,"The character with the dogs seems interesting, however i am not really a fan of these characters all too much. All of them just seem a little too random and unrelatable."
1743,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Arcade; Casino; Puzzle; Sports; Word,,1 looks very strong and tuff.  2 looks like a badass and has a very cool weapon to kill with.
1744,Male,$0-30k,White,High School,25-34,Action; Adventure; Puzzle; Word; Music,,"1, I am really interested in the fireman character, as it's very unusual in a game, and makes it more unique and interesting to me, the details in the clothing and faces looks high quality.2, I find the young character to be an interesting twist to a character, not something often seen in games."
1745,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Sports; Strategy; Arcade; Adventure; Action,,i like these two characters because they have an art style that is pleasing and not seen before
1746,Male,$0-30k,Hispanic,Less than High School Diploma,25-34,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Role Playing; Simulation,,I like 1 because its tough and looks like its been through a million zombies and ready for a million more. 2 is good because the dogs look poised and ready for war.
1747,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Role Playing; Strategy,,I like the firefighter character the most because this character looks the strongest out of all the characters shown here. I also like the destroyer chainsaw wielding man in this character design image because he looks rather tough and more exciting and the line work and colors look impressive on this character.
1748,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,Puzzle; Action; Adventure; Strategy; Music,,"A fighting fireman, sounds like a winner."
1749,Male,$61-100k,White,Vocational Training,25-34,Action; Adventure; Role Playing; Simulation,,I really like my first click. A girl with a skateboard and a bat with nails is pretty cool. The guy with the chainsaw reminds me of someone from a batman movie or American Psycho
1750,Male,$61-100k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,21-24,Card; Strategy; Simulation; Adventure; Action,,"These two characters look the most interesting to me. I like the character that has the 2 dogs, I imagine she might have them as a summon of some kind, the other charcter with the skateboard might have a lot of mobility, overall very interesting."
1751,Male,$101k+,White,High School,35-44,Simulation; Strategy; Puzzle,,"I like the firefighter because it's relatable, and expected to be strong and wield an axe.  His shield looks neat, like he could also have some defensive capabilities.  The woman with the dogs is interesting because the dogs could add some complicated mechanics that make for good strategy game play."
1752,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Racing; Arcade; Board; Adventure; Action,,These two had some amazing and very very lethal looking weaponry and something about their stance and faces that really look like they mean business.
1753,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,Family; Puzzle; Action; Role Playing; Strategy,,"The fireman looks robust and seems somewhat realistic. The punk with the chainsaw in 2 also seems realistic in a post-apocalyptic mindset. How would the females pictured here maintain those looks, its not remotely realistic."
1754,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Casino; Puzzle; Trivia,,I like the fireman character the best and he is the only one that really stands out to me. I like that he is still dressed in his job from before the zombie apocalypse and I like the weapon he has chosen. I think the two women are too bright and flashy. I don't care for the skateboard or the dogs. I also think  the chainsaw guy looks too much like a zombie and I don't care for the head style.
1755,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Adventure; Casino; Music; Sports,,I like these two characters the most for this game because they are compelling with the way they look and their attitudes are tough and bold and I also like their costumes and weaponry.
1756,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Trivia; Card; Casino; Sports,,I like the girl with the dogs I think any character that has dogs is cool and fun to play with. I like the apocalyptic fireman also it's very well designed
1757,Male,$61-100k,Hispanic,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Strategy; Sports; Action; Role Playing; Racing,,I think that these two characters are well prepared to go into battle in a setting like this. One has his chainsaw and the other and th eother has the two dos with her weapon of choice as well.
1758,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Adventure; Strategy; Role Playing,,I only like the firefighter.  He looks pretty cool.  The others seem silly.
1759,Male,$0-30k,White,High School,35-44,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Role Playing; Puzzle,,"There are two very different styles at play here. The more grounded, although still slightly outlandish firefighter and logger, and the over the top cyberpunk like style of the other two. I much rather play something slightly more grounded."
1760,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Puzzle; Sports; Strategy,,I really only like the firefighter because he has a relatable role in society and also seems like he would be really resourceful when it comes to fighting zombies.  I like that he transformed his regular gear into weapons and that he is really big and tough looking.
1761,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,25-34,Action; Casino; Arcade; Trivia,,"I think that all of these characters offer fun features that would be a blast to use in a game about zombies. I am especially drawn to the chainsaw man, this looks like it would be very effective at killing zombies. I think that these characters are very detailed and look really nice."
1762,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Adventure; Puzzle; Role Playing; Strategy,,I chose the firefighter as my favorite because I can relate to a person being a firefighter.  My second favorite character is a skateboarder because it looks like a kid and I think it would be fun to play a zombie game with a kid.
1763,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,35-44,Simulation; Puzzle; Card; Board; Adventure,,He looks like he is straight out of a horror movie and she looks like she is from the walking dead.
1764,Male,$61-100k,Hispanic,Graduate Degree,45-54,Arcade; Sports; Card; Puzzle,,"I would pick these two as the most interesting of the four options.  My 1st pick is the skater girl because that is a character you wouldn't necessarily think of as dealing with zombies, but think it could be an interesting character to play the game with.  2nd choice is more because of the dogs that are the characters companions in the image.  Like to see how that would unfold in the game."
1765,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Trivia; Puzzle; Educational; Board; Action,,I just really like the 2 dogs but I really like the big guy also I think they'd play the best characters depending on their listed strengths and weaknesses
1766,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Word; Puzzle; Strategy; Adventure; Action,,"i like the big shield on the guy, it looks scary, and i like the idea of having dogs with you"
1767,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Casino; Trivia; Word; Action; Arcade,,I am not a fan fo these characters if they are supposed to be heroes.  The fashionista with dogs she would never have.  The fireman who looks like a bad guy.  The others I can give or take
1768,Male,$101k+,White,Graduate Degree,25-34,Card; Role Playing; Strategy; Sports; Casino,,"I like the thought of playing as a fireman in the concept of this game, so that'd be my first option. My second option gives off some Harley Quinn vibes, which I also think would be fun to play a character as."
1769,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Casino; Adventure; Strategy,,My top two look the most unique and have a freestyle vibe to them that would look fun to play as in a zombie game
1770,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,25-34,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Racing; Simulation,,I love these characters the most because they are the most badass looking characters and would be the most fun to play with.
1771,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Trivia; Strategy,,I think that my first choice would be really fun and enjoyable to play as.  It looks like a character I would normally choose and would hav efun playing as.
1772,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Casino; Adventure; Racing; Sports; Word,,These are the 2 figures that stand out the most to me but I would probably not buy the figures because I am not much of a figure collector.
1773,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Adventure; Puzzle; Racing; Role Playing; Simulation,,"The last option has a chainsaw, and the second choice with the dogs seems to have a crossbow.  Both are ready for action against zombies!"
1774,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Adventure; Strategy; Role Playing; Simulation,,The firefighter is the only one I like. He looks normal.
1775,Male,$61-100k,Asian,Graduate Degree,25-34,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Racing; Sports,,I clicked on the two characters that I would like to play as in a zombie-themed apocalyptical game.  I liked the man with the chainsaw and the woman with the two dogs.
1776,Male,$31-60k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Strategy; Action; Adventure; Arcade; Role Playing,,"The chainsaw in my top choice is striking and intimidating. I like the purple color scheme of my second choice, which caught ky eye. Overall it's a nice set of designs for sure!"
1777,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Sports,,"These two are the characters that I like the most because they both go together well and fit with what I feel like would be a more whacky, fun, vibrant and bright post-apocalyptic survival/zombie-themed game that would have a Borderlands type vibe to it. I like the look of the skateboarder girl because she seems like she would be a little badass who wouldn't take shit from anyone. I dig how her hair looks. The other choice looks like she would be really cool as well. I like her style and hair. The giant gun and two dogs fit with her as well."
1778,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,Music; Strategy; Word,,I prefer these two characters. They look like a cross between Road Warrior and Rocky Horror Picture Show -- you don't want to tangle with them!
1779,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Adventure; Puzzle; Card; Action; Strategy,,I think the firefighter is a great concept.  He's covered up and well protected with his equipment he uses for his job.  The others are too exposed or just silly.  Presumably you don't want to get in that close with a chainsaw or you'll get bitten.  The dogs seem like a likely vector for infection also.  The purple girl has a ton of exposed skin.
1780,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Adventure; Action,,"I like the weapon choice for the two I selected best. I'm still not wild about the artwork, though."
1781,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Action; Arcade; Word,,I liked these two because they looked strong and powerful and could survive.
1782,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Board; Simulation; Strategy; Puzzle; Role Playing,,I picked these two because I think they have the coolest looing weapons
1783,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Strategy; Word,,"I like that one guy has a huge shield because he is a defensive player, and also like that the other guy has a very large chainsaw that he is obviously used before"
1784,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,35-44,Casino; Adventure; Arcade; Action; Role Playing,,"I prefer to play the strong bulky characters since they're built like tanks, slow and strong."
1785,Male,$0-30k,White,High School,35-44,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Strategy; Sports,,I really like the art design for all of these characters. I picked the first one because it's really cool that she uses as a skateboard to travel and im also assuming as a weapon when needed along side the baseball bat. I really like how the second character I selected has a chainsaw as a weapon and also looks to wear facepaint. Very awesome designs!
1786,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Sports; Adventure; Strategy; Role Playing,,"I selected these two characters because I like their weapons much more than the others. I think they would be fun to use from a gameplay perspective. Skating around and hitting people with a spiked bat could be interesting and whimsical. A chainsaw is always classic and fun, and can be a hilariously over the top gore fest."
1787,Male,$101k+,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Puzzle; Board; Card; Strategy; Trivia,,I like the firefighter character the most - I'm interested to know his back story and he seems to have cool weapons.
1788,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Word,,"The weapon choice mattered more to me than the character did.  The character did come into play a little bit, but I like bashing zombies more."
1789,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,25-34,Sports; Role Playing,,I think the fireman is really cool because of his size and the girl is really cool because she has two dogs working with her!
1790,Male,$61-100k,Asian,Graduate Degree,25-34,Word; Trivia; Puzzle; Arcade; Action,,"For a post apocalyptic survival game, a ""maniac"" character with a chainsaw makes some degree of sense while still being cool. A firefighter also makes sense as a character, as emergency services workers would certainly be active during such a crisis. I made my decisions based on what I think would make sense in such an environment."
1791,Male,$0-30k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Board; Card,,The characters looks authentic. I find it easy on the eyes.
1792,Male,$101k+,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Adventure; Puzzle,,"I prefer post apocalyptic games to be dark and war torn. These characters look very cartoonish and cute. For example, #4, why would an individual wear a doctor's outfit during a post apocalyptic fight? Makes no sens."
1793,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Role Playing; Strategy,,"I do not like the concept character art design styles shown here because these characters, especially the first and third characters, have too much black on their outfits, which makes them difficult to see clearly. I also do not like the facial expression of the larger man nor the style of his pants and shoes very much. I like the shovel wielding blue woman wearing the scientific coat the most because she looks very smart."
1794,Male,$61-100k,Other,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Adventure,,I really like the art style! Has a unique feel to it despite being animated looking characters. Very defined.
1795,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,Family; Puzzle; Action; Role Playing; Strategy,,"The characters seem to be thin in design and engenderment. This does not look like average people, but the characters do look good for a game."
1796,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Trivia; Card; Casino; Sports,,This has more of a anime feel to it. I think would be fun to mess around with and see what happens with all these guys
1797,Male,$0-30k,White,High School,35-44,Puzzle; Role Playing; Arcade; Trivia; Strategy,,I like this art style a good bit as it reminds me of fighters but they still look like people at their professions when the world went bad
1798,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Sports; Strategy; Arcade; Adventure; Action,,i like the art style because the characters are made to look adventurous but not tacky
1799,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Racing; Arcade; Board; Adventure; Action,,I love the detail and that the characters seem like normal people who were forced to become killers. The style fits this idea and game theme very well.
1800,Male,$0-30k,White,High School,25-34,Action; Adventure; Puzzle; Word; Music,,"The art style is fairly unique, a more uncommon style that provides depth and detail to the characters, while also allowing me to feel connected and interested in their lives and style."
1801,Male,$0-30k,Hispanic,Less than High School Diploma,25-34,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Role Playing; Simulation,,The art style is a little to clean for me but i like the characters and the overall designs. These all look tough and ready for battle but they are a little too clean they need to be more battle worn.
1802,Male,$61-100k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,21-24,Card; Strategy; Simulation; Adventure; Action,,I think the artstyle is nice but not the most appealing. I see this type of polygonal art style used for a ton of different games and most of them are cheap and die off quickly or fade into irrelevance.
1803,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Arcade; Casino; Puzzle; Sports; Word,,I DON'T LIKE THE CHARACTERS THAT MUCH.  THEY ARE BORING AND NOT COOL.
1804,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Adventure; Board; Card; Casino,,This art seems more like modern criminal game versus dealing with zombies.   Also I don't like the small heads to bodies proportions.
1805,Male,$61-100k,White,Vocational Training,25-34,Action; Adventure; Role Playing; Simulation,,These looks so familiar to Team Fortress characters. Especially #2. I feel like i've seen these before. I like the cat with the dual wielding sword girl.
1806,Male,$101k+,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Word; Strategy; Role Playing; Adventure; Action,,I feel like the art style is a bit muted although I do like it. The design heavily reminds me of Zelda Wind Waker of which I am very fond of. The cell shading style is top notch. My main complaint is that there isn't anything to set it apart from similar styles. The characters seems a bit stiff with the same or similar poses. The male character seems a bit boring while the three female characters are much more interesting.
1807,Male,$0-30k,White,Associate Degree,25-34,Simulation; Role Playing; Word; Adventure; Action,,I think its a pretty cool and unique art design
1808,Male,$101k+,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Arcade; Casino; Card; Trivia; Role Playing,,I love the medical person with the shovel However not a lot of detail n the face features and too much pixilation for todays games
1809,Male,$0-30k,White,Associate Degree,35-44,Action; Puzzle; Strategy,,I would give this game a shot for sure because of these characters. I love the look of these characters being normal but yet using things from their jobs in the past to survive. It has more of the feel of a real survivor game.
1810,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Casino; Puzzle; Trivia,,I really like the art style shown here. It reminds me of breath of the wild for Zelda. Its not entirely cartoonish but the shading gives off just a hint of that and its a nice mix of realistic and animated.
1811,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Adventure; Casino; Music; Sports,,This art style is not as exciting as the last one presented.  It is not bad but is rather bland when you consider the theme of the game and what the characters would be doing.
1812,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Puzzle; Sports; Strategy,,I like that they are all generally regular sized people with seemingly normal roles in society that just picked up what was closest to them when the zombies attacked.
1813,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Adventure; Strategy; Role Playing,,"The shading seems too heavy and a lot of the details too small for a game, but the art style itself is good."
1814,Male,$61-100k,Hispanic,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Strategy; Sports; Action; Role Playing; Racing,,These characters for the most part look a little boring. I like some of their weapons but the characters themselves dont fit except for the big construction guy. The others look too frail.
1815,Male,$31-60k,Black,Associate Degree,25-34,Music; Family; Casino; Board,,The theme is close and looks real.
1816,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Adventure; Puzzle; Role Playing; Strategy,,I really like these characters because I like that they appear to be real life people that have real life jobs and I can relate to them.  It would make me want to play with them in the game.
1817,Male,$61-100k,Hispanic,Graduate Degree,45-54,Arcade; Sports; Card; Puzzle,,"I like the art style.  I think it has kind of an anime feel to it.  Style is good, but the characters are not that interesting to me.  Really only the young girl with the swords interests me."
1818,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Casino; Trivia; Word; Action; Arcade,,the characters are good.  I think the art is a bit juvenile and could be a done better.  I look at the characters and can come up wiht a back story for each.
1819,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Strategy; Puzzle; Adventure,,I love the art style as it looks very detailed and fun. I really like how sexy the female characters look.
1820,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Word; Puzzle; Strategy; Adventure; Action,,"honestly they dont have must of a apocalypic theme at all, they just look like characters that can be in any game, i dont get a theme here at all"
1821,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Casino; Adventure; Strategy,,"It's fortnite esque, which isn't a bad thing, I think the shading just needs to be a tad lass contrast"
1822,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Casino; Adventure; Racing; Sports; Word,,"The figures do not really stand out to me, I do not buy many figures so I would probably not buy this."
1823,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Trivia; Strategy,,"I think the characters look a little boring, but it could make the game seem more realistic.  I think the design is pretty good and the color usage is attractive"
1824,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Adventure; Strategy; Role Playing; Simulation,,The only one of these I like is the construction worker. The ladies just look to dark and weird.
1825,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,25-34,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Racing; Simulation,,I love the style and design of these characters because they are relatable yet they look so fascinating and fun to play with in the game.
1826,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Adventure; Puzzle; Racing; Role Playing; Simulation,,I think the art style is well rendered.  The heads all seem rather small though.  I like the weapons they all have.
1827,Male,$31-60k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Strategy; Action; Adventure; Arcade; Role Playing,,"I like it! The art style is fun and sleek, and the bright colors caught my eye. Very cool for sure!"
1828,Male,$61-100k,Asian,Graduate Degree,25-34,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Racing; Sports,,I really like the character with the school girl outfit with the two swords and the black cat.
1829,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Adventure; Puzzle; Card; Action; Strategy,,The cell shading makes it look very divorced from reality.  Generally I expect these type of games to be gritty and realistic.  The characters shouldn't have so much exposed or lightly clothed skin if there are zombies about.
1830,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Adventure; Action,,The characters look a bit too bland
1831,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Strategy; Simulation,,The characters seem a bit boring. I can't really tell how I would play as any of them and I don't get a sense I would like the game.
1832,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,Music; Strategy; Word,,"I love this style. The female characters look attractive yet menacing. And the big guy looks to be the leader, looking like a street worker from hell."
1833,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Action; Arcade; Word,,I thought it was a good mix of characters and they didn__ look too extreme but looked like every day people trying to make it.
1834,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Board; Simulation; Strategy; Puzzle; Role Playing,,I like the rt style because the character's proportions are exaggerate to highlight their differences
1835,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,35-44,Casino; Adventure; Arcade; Action; Role Playing,,"I've always liked this particular style, but it's going to be difficult to use in this type of game without looking too cartoony, it's usually for kids games."
1836,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Strategy; Word,,"Like the tall guy that is second from the left, I think he has a big hook because he can draw enemies into combat"
1837,Male,$101k+,White,Graduate Degree,25-34,Racing,,"I like the characters but the style of the art makes me squint my eyes, I really wish it was either a higher resolution or more cartoon like."
1838,Male,$101k+,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Puzzle; Board; Card; Strategy; Trivia,,I like the style quite a bit and I think it would work well for a Zombie theme - the animation reminds me of the animation use in the Kill Bill movies.
1839,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Sports; Adventure; Strategy; Role Playing,,"These characters with the exception of the school girl with the cat are completely boring. I can't picture getting excited by a construction worker, a generic lady with a gun, or someone with a shovel. I think the shading is nice but the hair on each character needs some work to be more clearly defined. I really like the cat as its cute and an unexpected touch. I think some of the characters also have too much going on as far as their costumes and too many accessories. I can't picture these looking as good while moving. I do like the vibrant colors used overall, though I think the school girl could be less matchy-matchy with her hair."
1840,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Word,,"The art is a bit simplified, but it's still nice.  The game fits the theme well.  I especially like some of the weapons, which is what really sticks out to me."
1841,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Strategy; Simulation; Role Playing; Adventure; Action,,"Extremely strong style. Passes the silhouette test easily. The characters themselves all seem very different and unique, very cool."
1842,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Role Playing; Strategy,,I very much like the concept art character design styles and art styles shown here. I like the firefighter with the red snow board and the dogs and the chainsaw wielding man in this character design image the most because they look tougher and more exciting and the line work and colors look impressive. I like the firefighter character the most because this character looks the strongest out of all the characters shown here.
1843,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Sports; Strategy; Arcade; Adventure; Action,,i like the new art style but admittedly some of the colors are too bright and tacky for me
1844,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Trivia; Card; Casino; Sports,,I like the drawings. Like how it kinda has a cartoonish apocalyptic look to it. I think it really stands out and would be fun to play
1845,Male,$0-30k,White,High School,35-44,Puzzle; Role Playing; Arcade; Trivia; Strategy,,This character art is cool i like the bright pops of color and the very stylized look that is almost comic book looking.
1846,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Racing; Arcade; Board; Adventure; Action,,My favorite things about the style is that it really looks like normally people who were forced to adapt themselves into killers to ward off the threat. I like it very much.
1847,Male,$0-30k,White,High School,25-34,Action; Adventure; Puzzle; Word; Music,,"The details are very abundant and plentiful, this makes me feel very connected and interested in the characters as they look like they have been through many difficulties, and that makes me feel more interested and intrigued by them."
1848,Male,$0-30k,Hispanic,Less than High School Diploma,25-34,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Role Playing; Simulation,,I love this style because they are so rugged and tough and look like they have all been through a war and are ready to return and do it all again.
1849,Male,$61-100k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,21-24,Card; Strategy; Simulation; Adventure; Action,,"I would definitely prefer this type of art style, it looks very aesthetic and looks like a lot of work has been put into it. It reminds me a lot of higher company art styles and I would expect good gameplay from this app due to art style."
1850,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Arcade; Casino; Puzzle; Sports; Word,,"OVERALL THE CHARACTERS ARE COOL.  THEY ALL HAVE DIFFERENT WEAPONS, LOOKS, ETC. THEY FIT THE THEME."
1851,Male,$101k+,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Word; Strategy; Role Playing; Adventure; Action,,"I think the art style is great. It seems very fluid like see the blood splatter from the chain saw and dynamic with the shadows. The colors pop and stand out to me quite well. I think in a busy screen, it would super easy to see where my character was. Every character seems to have multiple colors to make them stand out. I feel like the art for each character is well-defined that I wouldn't have issues identifying them, once I play a bit, at a glance which is great."
1852,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Adventure; Board; Card; Casino,,I like the art because it shows more what is expected for different people needs to fight off the zombies.  I just like the style of characters and their apparel.
1853,Male,$61-100k,White,Vocational Training,25-34,Action; Adventure; Role Playing; Simulation,,I like the art alot. Looks very inline with the post apocalyptic / zombie genre. Firefighter guy looks like a tank. These characters remind me of people from Tank Girl.
1854,Male,$0-30k,White,Associate Degree,35-44,Action; Puzzle; Strategy,,It looks interesting but a bit over the top. Not everything has to be real and things can be exaggerate so I think I would give this a shot. I like that they have people who look like actual workers at jobs when this started and had to make the best they can out of what they got.
1855,Male,$101k+,White,High School,25-34,Strategy; Action; Adventure; Role Playing; Puzzle,,I like the art style. The characters look fun and probably have some cool back stories to go with them. I'm interested.
1856,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Adventure; Casino; Music; Sports,,I like this art style very much because it is creative and bold and engaging for such a game theme.  It is exciting to imagine these characters in action.
1857,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Casino; Puzzle; Trivia,,"I like some of the characters looks like the fireman and the chainsaw guy, but the other two people are too bright and flashy. I think they try to add too many colors on those two and all the pinks and purple shades don't look well on them."
1858,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Puzzle; Sports; Strategy,,"I don't really like the oversized people and weapons because they are a little less relatable.  I also don't like the chainsaw guy because he looks like an evil villain.  Minor note as well, zombies don't typically have blood since they are dead, so the blood splatter on his chainsaw is out of place."
1859,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Adventure; Strategy; Role Playing,,"Except for the firefighter, these all seem too over the top and silly, and not thematic to a survival game."
1860,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,25-34,Action; Casino; Arcade; Trivia,,"I think the characters offer a good mix of fun ways to play this game and kill zombies. I am especially attracted to the guy with the chainsaw, he looks like a blast to play with. The characters are very realistic looking."
1861,Male,$61-100k,Hispanic,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Strategy; Sports; Action; Role Playing; Racing,,I like this art style a lot as the character were well created. They all have some good detail put into them. Details that help transform you to the theme of the game.
1862,Male,$31-60k,Black,Associate Degree,25-34,Music; Family; Casino; Board,,The theme looks so dangerous
1863,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Adventure; Puzzle; Role Playing; Strategy,,"These characters look pretty good, but I don't like them as much as the other group of characters.  These seem more cartoonish and not as easy to relate to, but I think the artwork looks nice."
1864,Male,$61-100k,Hispanic,Graduate Degree,45-54,Arcade; Sports; Card; Puzzle,,Art style is good.  It is distinctive style that looks different from other games.  Fits the post-apocalyptic setting for the game.
1865,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Casino; Trivia; Word; Action; Arcade,,the characters are not going to be easy to root for.  I see them people I do not like.
1866,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Strategy; Puzzle; Adventure,,I think it looks great and very realistic. I love the weapons as they are very fun and unique.
1867,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Word; Puzzle; Strategy; Adventure; Action,,"i think the fireman guy has the best design that fits the theme, there seems to pretty good horror theme here but it leans a bit to more that way from zombie"
1868,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Casino; Adventure; Strategy,,The overall design and color scheme is very well. The faces need a little touch up in shading/lighting
1869,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Casino; Adventure; Racing; Sports; Word,,I do not really like the art style and would not buy the product.
1870,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,25-34,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Racing; Simulation,,I absolutely love the style that these characters are because they look so tough and badass making them perfect.
1871,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Trivia; Strategy,,I think the style is pretty cool and unique.  The colors are vibrant and make the characters look fun to play as.
1872,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Adventure; Strategy; Role Playing; Simulation,,The firefighter is the only one I like. The others look to dark and weird.
1873,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Adventure; Puzzle; Racing; Role Playing; Simulation,,"The art style looks cool and modern, but the faces are rather small.  I like that they are colorful and seem to be nice 3D renderings."
1874,Male,$61-100k,Asian,Graduate Degree,25-34,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Racing; Sports,,I love post-apocalyptic games and I love the designs of the characters.
1875,Male,$31-60k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Strategy; Action; Adventure; Arcade; Role Playing,,"I like the sleek and modern design of the characters, but the color scheme is a bit drap for my tastes. It needs some color and pep!"
1876,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Adventure; Puzzle; Card; Action; Strategy,,"I really like the fire fighter.  If everything was going to be like that I would like it better.  The other characters looks like they are out of an anime.  If it is zombies, you shouldn't have so much exposed skin."
1877,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,Music; Strategy; Word,,I like this style. It is very '80s in orientation. The one on the right looks straight out of a horror film that I cannot place. But is very appealing to me.
1878,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Adventure; Action,,"I don't really like the character design that much. It looks like it could be fun, but possibly too serious."
1879,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Sports,,"I am very likely to like the art style because it seems like it is a fun, vibrant and interesting look. I like how colorful everything is and how it has that look to it but still also has some realism to it as well. I like that a lot about it. It kind of reminds me of the style that the Borderlands games have to them but it leans into the realism look a bit more."
1880,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Action; Arcade; Word,,I think the art style is inclusive and diverse and has a wide array of characters for different users to choose from.
1881,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Board; Simulation; Strategy; Puzzle; Role Playing,,I like the style a lot. I like that the proportions on the characters are exaggerated to highlight their unique qualities
1882,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,35-44,Casino; Adventure; Arcade; Action; Role Playing,,"I think the art design is pretty good but the characters seem a bit over the top.  At least it doesn't look too childish, and more mature."
1883,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Strategy; Word,,"I forgot on the left because he has huge shield, I think he's a good team player wants to protect us"
1884,Male,$101k+,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Puzzle; Board; Card; Strategy; Trivia,,I like the art style quite a bit - I kind of reminds me of Aeon Flux from the 1990s. I think it would work well for a Zombie game.
1885,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Word,,"The art is a little bit simple and nothing 'wowing', but I like it for this type of game.  It fits well and makes me interested in checking it out."
1886,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,25-34,Sports; Role Playing,,I think the style is really cool and all of the characters have unique features that make me feel like they each will have certain powers they can use in battle.
1887,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Sports; Adventure; Strategy; Role Playing,,"I like all the bright and vibrant colors in the art style. I think each character is a bit too busy in terms of details and accessories as I do not think these will show up well during gameplay unless the characters are only static. I also do not like the oversized dogs. Overall, the colors are nice but I'm less fond of some of the darker looking choices like the grays and blacks as primary colors for some of the characters."
1888,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,Sports,,Looks interesting and would like to know more but there seem to be many of these types of games on the market so the market could be saturated for these.
1889,Male,$0-30k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Board; Card,,The art style is visually appealing. I find it stands out well.
1890,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Board; Card; Racing; Puzzle,,"It is too realistic looking for me, I prefer my games to look more cartoonish."
1891,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,35-44,Adventure; Simulation; Strategy; Trivia; Role Playing,,"I think they are all interesting, however maybe a little busy.   I would simplify them a little, it'll probably help you as well by making the animation process simpler"
1892,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Simulation,,I like option A a little better because the characters appear a little more developed to me and more meet my standards for a game in this day and age.
1893,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,Casino; Puzzle,,"I definitely like option A, the characters are more detailed and expressive.  I like the fireman's spiked shield."
1894,Male,$61-100k,Black,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Adventure; Racing; Strategy; Action; Simulation,,"This was a very difficult choice. I think Option A has the better art style in terms of presentation. Although both art styles look great, Option B's art style seems like it would be actual game render. Option A looks more like something that I'd see on a box or app store graphic. Now I would also choose Option B but ONLY if that is how the characters looked in game. If not, I'd stick with Option A."
1895,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Sports; Strategy; Arcade; Adventure; Action,,i prefer the art style in option A because it has more of a fantasy feel to it
1896,Male,$0-30k,Hispanic,High School,25-34,Role Playing; Adventure; Action,,I really like option B because the characters on option A look a tad overdesigned for an apocalyptic game. While the characters on option B look like they gathered whatever equipment they could get their hands on. I really like the look on the girl with dual katanas and the construction worker with the hook.
1897,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,Family; Puzzle; Action; Role Playing; Strategy,,The styling for A tells a much more interesting story than the style for B. The style for B looks like they are missing something.
1898,Male,$0-30k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Role Playing; Strategy,,"Option B has a scientist among the characters, creates the sense of knowledge is power."
1899,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Music; Puzzle; Sports,,"I prefer this characters because they look very cool and fascinating, they also appear more fierce and like untouchable."
1900,Male,$0-30k,Black,High School,25-34,Action; Role Playing; Simulation; Sports; Word,,These characters seem to have more diversity to them
1901,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,35-44,Simulation; Puzzle; Card; Board; Adventure,,They look more like they have taken things they have scavenged to put together their clothing and supplies to fight and survive.
1902,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Racing; Arcade; Board; Adventure; Action,,This design style has a more detailed look that fits the style of game best and it has characters that have the better weaponry as well.
1903,Male,$61-100k,White,Associate Degree,35-44,Puzzle; Trivia,,I like option A because the characters are larger than life looking super heros.
1904,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,Adventure; Strategy; Role Playing,,"I don't like the many super skinny, waif-like characters in the other art style, but what immediately drew me to this was the guy with a chainsaw. I can easily visualize playing this character, and what they would be like in combat, and how fun it would be."
1905,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Arcade; Strategy; Trivia; Role Playing; Simulation,,The characters are more vibrant and eye catching.
1906,Male,$61-100k,Other,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Adventure,,I find the art style for option B to be more attractive. I can see the intricacies of the characters more for option B over option A personally.
1907,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,25-34,Action; Adventure; Strategy; Puzzle; Sports,,Option A character designs look the most enticing. The way that they are presented makes the game seem like there would be a lot of bloody battles. The character with a large shield attracts my attention the most.
1908,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Adventure; Strategy; Role Playing,,"It's a tough choice.  I think A has more memorable characters, but they seem over the top to me.  Still, I'll go with them."
1909,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Adventure; Board; Card; Casino,,I like how the characters are more proportionally right and like the apparel better.
1910,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Role Playing; Strategy,,"I prefer the option A concept art character design because I like the firefighter with the red snow board and the dogs and the chainsaw wielding man in this character design image the most because they look tougher and more exciting than the option B characters, which look much more plain and boring to me. I like the firefighter character the most because they look the strongest out of all the characters shown here in the option A character image."
1911,Male,$0-30k,Hispanic,Less than High School Diploma,25-34,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Role Playing; Simulation,,I prefer these because it has a tougher meaner and more rugged look to it. I would imagine something from post apocalyptic landscape to look exactly like this.
1912,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Trivia; Card; Casino; Sports,,I like the girl that has the two dogs. She looks cool and be very fun to
1913,Male,$0-30k,White,High School,35-44,Puzzle; Role Playing; Arcade; Trivia; Strategy,,I like both of them a good bit and it probably depend on the look of the world overall how they would look. But i say this option looks more like they live in a world where they are surviving and look more like regular people turned into fighters
1914,Male,$101k+,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Word; Strategy; Role Playing; Adventure; Action,,"I like definitely like the art style in A over B. The style seems more dynamic and fluid. I like that it has shadows and splashes of colors while B seems more muted in comparison. However, I think I like the character design of B more than A. The characters in A seem too into the extreme like these characters went started off in the style if B then went crazy and became what they are in A. The doctor and soldier in B look like ones I would choose the most with the fireman in A being third. The other characters don't seem that interesting to me."
1915,Male,$0-30k,White,High School,25-34,Action; Adventure; Puzzle; Word; Music,,"The style looks more detailed while also making it look more realistic, and cartoony at the same time, the details make me feel more interested and connected to the characters."
1916,Male,$61-100k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,21-24,Card; Strategy; Simulation; Adventure; Action,,"I prefer option A's art style more than option B. I see the same tacky polygonal art style that option B has in many different games, and they often die off early or become irrelevant. Option A's art style looks like a lot of work was put into it and it looks very aesthetic."
1917,Male,$61-100k,White,Vocational Training,25-34,Action; Adventure; Role Playing; Simulation,,I prefer the Team Fortress look alikes much more than the blooded characters in Option A. Option B seems less gory and more approachable.
1918,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,Puzzle; Action; Adventure; Strategy; Music,,"B only because everyone has seen characters that are (pardon the term) bad-asses, with the group in B they are basic everyday people and so would be fun to see in a zombie apocalypse. Additionally, those would be the people that would survive not the  bad-asses because everyone would turn against them as a collective."
1919,Male,$0-30k,White,Associate Degree,35-44,Action; Puzzle; Strategy,,I like the grouping of B because it feels more real to me. I think both could be good depending on how over the top you make it but it feels like in B they are normal people trying to survive. I like the mix of real workers too in both except the chainsaw guy in A.
1920,Male,$101k+,White,High School,35-44,Simulation; Strategy; Puzzle,,"A's characters look more weathered, like they've been living in a post-apocalyptic world for a while.  B's characters look good, but are too clean and neat."
1921,Male,$101k+,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Arcade; Casino; Card; Trivia; Role Playing,,The eapons look more violent and the game looks funnier However I do like the medical worker shovel on the other one
1922,Male,$101k+,White,High School,25-34,Strategy; Action; Adventure; Role Playing; Puzzle,,The characters in option a look way cooler. I'd be more inclined to play that game. Some of the characters in option B look a bit silly.
1923,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Puzzle; Sports; Strategy,,I like the more noramlized fighters because they are more relatable and I like the fact that they look like they were surprised by the zombie attack and just picked up whatever was closest to them to use as a weapon.
1924,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,Card; Board; Racing; Puzzle; Adventure,,"I prefer to the Option B , that characters attracts me the most , their costume designs are very well . I like character structural designing . The most important thing to a character is their outer appearance and suitable costumes which are perfect to the cartoon characteristics ."
1925,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Casino; Puzzle; Trivia,,I like the shadings and the style of art in B a lot better. It gives off that breath of the wild look from Zelda and I like how it mixes realism and animation. I like the look of the construction guy the best in that set of images. The pants shading and the colors work well together. I think some of the colors in A don't go together as well such as the pink and purple shades on the two middle characters look too bright and out of place.
1926,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,25-34,Action; Casino; Arcade; Trivia,,"I would love to play as the fireman or the guy with the chainsaw, it seems like endless possibilities to kill zombies with."
1927,Male,$31-60k,Black,Associate Degree,25-34,Music; Family; Casino; Board,,I like the human like characters
1928,Male,$61-100k,Hispanic,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Strategy; Sports; Action; Role Playing; Racing,,These characters are more built to endure a game like this due to their build as well as the style that they put into creating them. They just look the part of a zombie game.
1929,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Action; Arcade; Role Playing; Strategy; Puzzle,,"I like this design style a lot better as the characters almost look normal, especially the big construction worker guy who is my favorite.  I also like that the design is not quite as dark as the other version, particularly the chainsaw and blood character."
1930,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Adventure; Puzzle; Role Playing; Strategy,,I chose option B because the characters and their outfits look more like everyday people.  I think this makes it easier to relate to them when you are playing.
1931,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Strategy; Puzzle; Adventure,,I like option B because the characters look more realistic and also include two sexy females.
1932,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Casino; Trivia; Word; Action; Arcade,,"When looking at both sets, I tried to come up with a backstory for each character based on their pre-apocalyptic life.  My answers for B were better and not as evil."
1933,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Trivia; Puzzle; Educational; Board; Action,,The weapon choice and these ones is better and sticks out a little more
1934,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Adventure; Casino; Music; Sports,,I prefer this art style for these characters because the costumes and other aspects are far more engaging and compelling when compared to the other option.
1935,Male,$61-100k,Hispanic,Graduate Degree,45-54,Arcade; Sports; Card; Puzzle,,I prefer choice A because it looks different from other styles I have seen.  Choice B is more similar to anime so I prefer something that stands out on it's own.
1936,Male,$31-60k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Strategy; Action; Adventure; Arcade; Role Playing,,"I like the use of bright orange, blue, and green colors in this choice, which are exciting and energetic. Very cool design for sure!"
1937,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Word; Puzzle; Strategy; Adventure; Action,,"they look a bit rougher, more scary, i really like the firefighter guy the most,"
1938,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Sports,,"Choice A is the art style that I prefer because it seems more gritty to me, more detailed looking and I like the look and shading that it has to it. In contrast I did not like how Choice B was not as detailed. The character I like the most is the girl with the skateboard. I really dig her look and her style that she has to her."
1939,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Trivia; Strategy,,"I think that the characters in option A look more fun and thrilling to play as.  The design looks more chaotic, which could be fun in game"
1940,Male,$101k+,White,Graduate Degree,25-34,Card; Role Playing; Strategy; Sports; Casino,,"I like certain aspects of both designs, but I lean towards option A especially when considering this is a zombie apocalypse style came. I think the character options in A would be more fun to play, although I like the thought of having more realistic characters as provided in option B."
1941,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,25-34,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Racing; Simulation,,I love these characters more because they are more badass and tough looking making them more exciting to play with.
1942,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Adventure; Puzzle; Racing; Role Playing; Simulation,,"I prefer the art style for option B because the characters looks slightly more like a cool RPG.  I can clearly tell what their weapons are, and they look more like normal people in a way."
1943,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Adventure; Puzzle; Card; Action; Strategy,,"I like the firefighter the most. It makes the most sense as a character in the apocalypse, these are people who we give armor to and train.   The art in A looks more realistic to me."
1944,Male,$61-100k,Asian,Graduate Degree,25-34,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Racing; Sports,,I really like the characters in option B more than option A's character.  I like the girl with the two swords.
1945,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,Music; Strategy; Word,,"I am more likely to gravitate toward B. The characters look more ""street"" and rough and tumble. Like the unsavory types you don't want to cross paths with at night."
1946,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Board; Simulation; Strategy; Puzzle; Role Playing,,The characters in A look really cool and I like the art style a lot
1947,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Strategy; Simulation,,"I think the characters in A look a lot cooler and more intense than those in B. I really like the crazy guy on the end with the chainsaw, seems like he would be fun to play as."
1948,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Action; Arcade; Word,,These character models were a bit more unique and interesting and diverse to me.

1952,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Sports; Adventure; Strategy; Role Playing,,I chose A because the characters look tougher and more likely to survive in a zombie post apocalyptic world. I think the construction worker in B looks super boring. I like the club and chainsaw weapons in A as they are classic zombie fair.
1953,Male,$31-60k,White,Associate Degree,25-34,Adventure; Arcade,,"I think they are more eye catching and it looks more bad ass per say for all the people, the other option the users look kind of basic."
1954,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,25-34,Sports; Role Playing,,I think the fireman art looks amazing and he would be an amazing character!
1955,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Strategy; Simulation; Role Playing; Adventure; Action,,"Each character has an obviously unique feature, and I can tell at a glance all their playstyles will be wildly different. And the contrast between the huge bulky  craneworker and the small schoolgirl with swords is striking."
1956,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Word,,"The weapons and look of this one seems simpler, which I like.  I don't need flashy, newly invented weapons.  This one better fits in my opinion."

1958,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,Board; Music; Strategy; Trivia; Arcade,,"I think option ""B"" is the most realistic and intense. Option ""A"" has that one anime looking character."
1959,Male,$0-30k,Black,Associate Degree,35-44,Arcade; Simulation; Board; Role Playing; Strategy,,"I like the more realistic look they have. Yes I like the look of A, but I rather have people that just got thrown into the zombies rather than they have been dealing with them for awhile"
1960,Male,$31-60k,White,Associate Degree,25-34,Casino; Puzzle; Strategy; Word,,These characters seem to fit the theme better. They are more cool and interesting compared to the others.
1961,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,35-44,Adventure; Simulation; Strategy; Trivia; Role Playing,,"although some of the characters in A are appealing, I find the ones in B to be more defined and clear, i would go with the set in B"
1962,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Adventure; Simulation; Puzzle,,The others remind me too much of a team fortress rip-off which has already been done
1963,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Strategy; Board,,I chose A because i dont like the tiny character models in B. They appear dainty and frail.
1964,Male,$0-30k,White,High School,25-34,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Music; Puzzle,,I picked A as my top choices as I love the bright colors.
1965,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Arcade; Puzzle; Word; Educational,,The characters have a more gritty style. The fireman looks like a real bad ass.
1966,Male,$0-30k,White,High School,25-34,Arcade; Card; Educational; Strategy; Puzzle,,I like the extra details and life that is given to this cast of characters
1967,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Word; Sports; Action,,Option A seems a bit more futuristic as they are quite extreme beating the more realistic version of characters. I think this genre is served best with a bit of over the top characters.
1968,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Sports; Role Playing; Puzzle,,These characters are more creative and interesting for this game.
1969,Male,$61-100k,White,High School,45-54,Adventure; Arcade; Simulation; Trivia,,"I like the construction guy in the set of character in option B, he doesn't look like your average style of character and could be a good/interesting character to play especially with the hook he has in his hands. I don;t really like the chainsaw character in option A, he looks too much like a character from the movies."
1970,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,21-24,Action; Adventure; Sports; Trivia; Simulation,,"Both of these are good but the art styles in A are bigger and louder and more outlandish, which I like"
1971,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Racing; Sports; Role Playing; Adventure; Action,,I felt like this was a good depiction of what these people would look like in a zombie apocalypse
1972,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Casino; Sports,,it seems more like everyday people instead of characters in a war.
1973,Male,$101k+,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Arcade; Action; Adventure,,I prefer B because it looks like the characters are normal people thrust into a post-apocalyptic situation. I like the construction guy with the big tow hook the best.
1974,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Racing; Trivia,,"I think B has more fun characters, and i like that they look like regular everyday people. i think that adds a fun element to it."

1976,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,Music; Family; Card; Arcade; Action,,i thought it was effective design
1977,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Simulation,,I like option A because they seem to be more pumped up / exaggerated versions. They look bigger and badder. I like the woman with the 2 dogs! Very cool character.
1978,Male,$0-30k,White,High School,35-44,Arcade; Racing; Puzzle; Trivia; Sports,,I like the variety and more outlandish costumes in the set in Option A. The characters all seem bigger than life and all stand out in their own ways with a good variety.
1979,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Strategy; Sports; Racing; Adventure; Action,,"I strongly prefer option A because I think that it is a much more interesting, detailed, and visually appealing art style. I especially like the fire fighter in option A because he exudes everything I like about this art style."
1980,Male,$31-60k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Action; Adventure; Role Playing; Simulation; Strategy,,I just feel the characters look way more unique and individual.
1981,Male,$31-60k,Asian,Graduate Degree,25-34,Trivia; Strategy; Simulation; Role Playing; Action,,"I choose A because the design of characters in A is unconventional but visually attractive, compared to B"
1982,Male,$0-30k,Asian,Associate Degree,25-34,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Role Playing; Simulation,,"I like the sharper design of Option B and how it is not too flashy, but still unique."
1983,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Action; Casino; Role Playing; Simulation; Sports,,I like the girl with the double katanas. Looks like it would be more interesting to fight zombies that way. I feel that it's more cartoonish and would be able to do more with a zombie setting.
1984,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,25-34,Strategy; Sports; Action; Puzzle; Simulation,,"I think the characters in Option B seem more relatable and realistic, so I prefer those. I think I like the construction worker best. He seems like just an ordinary guy who's doing his best."
1985,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Card; Arcade; Sports,,i like the look of the characters in choice b more than the characters in choice a
1986,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,Action; Arcade; Role Playing; Strategy; Word,,Option A looks like it has a little too much going on.  Option B is cleaner and easier to see the characters.
1987,Male,$101k+,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Casino; Trivia; Strategy; Sports; Puzzle,,The fireman is awesome!!!!  I like how big and colorful he is.  I like the accents on the drawings too. The shadows help add depth.
1988,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,35-44,Board; Card; Word,,"I like this set a bit more, reminds me some of stuff like Evil Dead and Tank Girl."
1989,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Adventure; Strategy; Role Playing; Simulation,,I like the construction worker in B.
1990,Male,$31-60k,White,Graduate Degree,45-54,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Trivia; Educational,,Option A's characters seem more prepared for the post-apocalyptic world than do the goofy folks in Option B.
1991,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Action; Role Playing; Sports; Card,,"The characters in B wear causal dress code. I am put myself in the same shoe as vividly as they are in the game. In addition, the tools they hold in hands are commonly seen in our daily life. It is very real as a survival game."
1992,Male,$0-30k,White,Associate Degree,25-34,Strategy,,"My overall favorite UI here would be the version in Choice B. Primarily due to the layout and choice of colors used in that example. Everything in that version stands out a lot more due to the background due to said choices, and I find the colors more pleasing to look at. Which is important since you'd probably be looking at this a lot of it's a strategy game."
1993,Female,$61-100k,Asian,Associate Degree,45-54,Strategy; Arcade,,I prefer the blue background as it feels more magical and mystical. The font also appears more wizard like
1994,Male,$0-30k,White,High School,25-34,Racing; Arcade; Role Playing; Strategy; Puzzle,,"I like the designs in choice B. I like the simplicity of the design, the font style, the background colors, the big character icons and the design of the menus as well."
1995,Male,$61-100k,Asian,Graduate Degree,25-34,Strategy; Simulation,,I think the first page in each is the most important. I ranked the options based on how appealing these images are
1996,Male,$61-100k,Black,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Adventure; Action; Role Playing; Strategy; Simulation,,I like option A the best because i like that the backgrounds make the icons easier to see.  The fonts seem more crisp to me compared to the other options as well.  The only change I would make is that I would make the background image in the first panel clear and not blurry.
1997,Male,$101k+,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Puzzle; Board; Card; Strategy; Trivia,,"I ranked my choices based on my preference for the title design and the color palette, which emphasizes the them best."
1998,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Strategy; Trivia; Puzzle; Card; Action,,I like how the outline of the boxes look in B.  C is pretty good too as the UI has more flair especially the bottom panel.  A is good too but rather expected and ordinary.
1999,Male,$61-100k,Hispanic,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Simulation; Sports; Strategy; Action; Adventure,,I like the color and designs of C
2000,Male,$31-60k,Black,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Puzzle; Strategy; Role Playing; Adventure; Action,,Options B and A have amazing color schemes that look good. The vibrant and easy on the eyes color schemes really these two options pop. I like the set up of the UI and how simple it is to understand.
2001,Female,$0-30k,White,Less than High School Diploma,35-44,Strategy; Action; Role Playing; Simulation,,The color of this background is nice. It makes the icons easier to process.
2002,Female,$0-30k,White,Associate Degree,25-34,Word; Strategy; Puzzle; Simulation; Role Playing,,"The font and icons/images in A are MUCH TOO SMALL, so I chose A last. If I could, in a perfect world, I would combine B and A to make the perfect mix of colors, icons and fonts. I like the darker background of B, as it is easier for me to read the words against the dark background. However, I like the font used in C better - it is bigger and more creative - and the images/icons of the characters faces are bigger."
2003,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,25-34,Action; Adventure; Strategy; Puzzle; Sports,,In my opinion option B stands out to me the most for a good UI. The icons look great and I really like the border that surrounds it to show that it's highlighted. I think the UI really fits the theme of the game well. I also feel like as the best font out of all the other options provided.
2004,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Sports; Strategy; Arcade; Adventure; Action,,i like the UI style in option A because it fits with the theme the best and has good coloring
2005,Male,$0-30k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Action; Adventure; Strategy; Arcade; Sports,,"I choose B, Because I like the icon which is more cute to look and more attractive and it's interface is cool to which I played a lot of games and this is what I like."
2006,Male,$31-60k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Strategy; Action; Adventure; Arcade; Role Playing,,"I like the bright blue colors used in my top choice, which is bold and confident. Very cool design fro sure!"
2007,Male,$61-100k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Strategy; Role Playing,,I liked choice A the best since the color scheme fits the more mystical and magic theme of the game. Choice A also has the tiles in a more pleasing design which look more appealing.
2008,Male,$61-100k,Other,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Strategy; Simulation; Role Playing; Puzzle; Educational,,"I think the light blue coloring in [C] gives the whole thing a more magical feel and looks more professional, the other two don't compare or compete. But if I had to choose, I like the opening screen (top) for [A] so that came second. [B] is bland all around."
2009,Male,$0-30k,White,Less than High School Diploma,35-44,Card; Role Playing; Adventure; Strategy; Arcade,,"I like C and think it has the best layout in terms of font, icons, etc."
2010,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Adventure; Strategy; Role Playing,,"In the bottom panels, the button icons in C are much nicer than the more plain menu-style navigation in the others."
2011,Male,$0-30k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Role Playing; Strategy,,Option B of brighter colored and bigger sized font makes it easier to read. Less having to zoom in or scroll around too much.
2012,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Adventure; Role Playing; Strategy,,I feel a bad the best detail in graphics and looks the best overall.
2013,Female,$61-100k,Hispanic,Graduate Degree,35-44,Music; Strategy; Simulation; Puzzle; Adventure,,B because the icon looks very fashionable and I  believe it makes the overall game look more inviting and a challenge for mez which I would enjoy.
2014,Male,$31-60k,White,Graduate Degree,25-34,Adventure; Simulation; Strategy; Sports; Trivia,,I definitely like this design the best. I like the font and style of the title the best by far. I looks great and also looks really good having the blue background across the whole design. The icons look like they are the brightest and the sharpest. I also like the way the information box is designed in the bottom of the screen
2015,Male,$101k+,White,High School,35-44,Simulation; Strategy; Puzzle,,"C's design look light and fluid, similar to some of Nintendo's UI designs, so I expect a great feel from it.  The text is easy to read, and simply styled.  B's design felt heavy and dated, like games that I played in the 90's.  The borders around the icons feel overdone.  A is ok, nothing really negative.  The blurred first panel seems overdone lately."
2016,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Action; Adventure; Strategy; Trivia; Word,,"I prefer the lighter, brighter background colors in choice A. I looks more inviting and happier. I would prefer to interact with it than any of the others"
2017,Male,$101k+,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Casino; Trivia; Strategy; Sports; Puzzle,,B- I like the large picture of the icon on the right on this one. Much better than the card options in c and aC-I like the font for the hero name on this one.  A- the colors are nice but I prefer the fonts and the layout of the other two
2018,Male,$0-30k,White,Associate Degree,35-44,Action; Puzzle; Strategy,,I really like that background blue because it really makes you focus on the the character or what you are doing with your stock. I think B is a good color but the lighter look is a bit bright when I want to focus on the supplies I have. I just feel that blue blends better and that could just be a personal preference. I think the background is nice in A for the character but after that it goes back to plain colors so it becomes a waist.
2019,Male,$101k+,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Word; Strategy; Role Playing; Adventure; Action,,"I like Option C the best. The opening screen I think looks the best and gives me an impression of a wider world. The character select screen is also nicely designed with the icons being bigger in both C and B. I prefer the scenery in C and A over B however. B's character select seems to be just a nebulous void. However, I think the backpack sidebar interface of B and A is much better than C. I think only having icons on the backpack sidebar is bad as unless you really know the game, I would have to click through all of them to find what I wanted.The fonts in all of them are nice. I think I prefer B over the other two since it seems cleaner and easier to read. A's font is second and C's font can get annoying with the dots in the actual text."
2020,Female,$0-30k,White,Graduate Degree,45-54,Card; Puzzle; Strategy; Trivia; Word,,"For this war strategy game inspired by the magic concept, out of the three user interface styles shown the one I like the most is Choice C. The graphical layout of this application looks easy to use and very entertaining. The visual elements interact with each other well- the font is gothic-like, but not too gothic and it matches with the title of the game and the theme. The color scheme and button shapes _ the width of lines and the fonts used for text are all perfect for a game inspired by the Magic concept."
2021,Female,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Adventure; Puzzle; Strategy,,i think the logo and font are more memorable
2022,Female,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Strategy; Music; Arcade; Puzzle; Trivia,,"I like C for the blue color which feels magical, and I like the font with the circle.  All three are cute though."
2023,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Strategy; Puzzle; Adventure,,I like option C because the layout is easy to follow and the fonts and images are slightly bigger making them easier to see and quickly notice.
2024,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,Strategy; Simulation; Role Playing,,"I think that the darker browns fit in better with the concept of the game. Magic is a dark game, so utilizing brighter colors in the UI seems out of place to me. The browns make the game feel more grounded."
2025,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Puzzle; Sports; Strategy,,I think the biggest difference is in the backpack screen where the list is clearly spelled out on the left.  I prefer A over B slightly because the title screen has bigger text and some action in the background.
2026,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,Adventure; Action; Role Playing; Strategy; Sports,,I like the lighter backgrounds easier to see things with
2027,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Action; Arcade; Role Playing; Strategy; Puzzle,,"In the last place choice the tool, button, and tile colors of the interface are way too close the the overall sky blue of the background.  It makes it difficult to tell the difference between where a control starts and where is just background.  The second place choice is not much better with the images included on the background it is still a little hard to tell where the controls are.  First place choice has the controls easy to see by using a mostly solid color background that does not blend in with them."
2028,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,Simulation; Role Playing; Arcade; Adventure; Action,,The layout for option A is the best. It's much more clear and concise. I found the fonts and graphics much more eye catching.
2029,Female,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Strategy; Word; Puzzle; Trivia,,"I find A extremely eye catching! The colors and design really draw in the eye. C is nice, but B is way too dark and doesn't look exciting or appealing."
2030,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Board; Simulation; Strategy; Puzzle; Role Playing,,The title screen shown in A is bright and cheery and drew me in right away
2031,Male,$101k+,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Strategy; Board; Sports; Trivia; Adventure,,"C grabs my attention and evokes wonder. B is difficult to process and read, and I find it less clear in terms of emotional response"
2032,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,25-34,Word; Strategy; Trivia,,"I didn__ like how dark and gloomy B seemed, so I ranked it the lowest. Next I thought the colors and emotions brought on by C were most uplifting and best for this type of game."
2033,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Arcade; Simulation; Strategy,,"Option C has the best UI. The game title font is proportional to the screen, there's better background graphics, and it's easier to see what you're looking for."
2034,Female,$61-100k,Other,Associate Degree,35-44,Strategy; Role Playing; Word; Trivia; Simulation,,I like C the best because it looks cleaner overall and I prefer the colors.
2035,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Strategy; Sports; Racing,,for magic theme i like dark
2036,Male,$0-30k,Black,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Role Playing; Strategy,,The colors give the game that medieval feel it's looking for
2037,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Trivia; Strategy,,I think that the colors in option C are appealing and calming.  I feel like this game would be immersive and fun to play.
2038,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Strategy; Simulation,,"I really like the visual of B the best. It seems the most ""adult"" and serious compared to the others, it has a cool look and I think would be easy to navigate around in."
2039,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,35-44,Action; Adventure; Role Playing; Simulation; Strategy,,"B is great I like the darker background as I feel it is easier on the eyes and makes the icons pop out much more.  A also looks good and I like but B just looks better, sometimes less is more and I feel B works very well. C is a tad out dated looking, hard to say why exactly, but I just dislike it"
2040,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Sports; Adventure; Strategy; Role Playing,,I like the palette of C the best as it is the most vibrant and interesting looking. A is a very plain palette but in some ways easier to read than A. B is my least favorite as it is the least legible and the color palette is drab and uninspired.
2041,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Adventure; Puzzle; Card; Action; Strategy,,I think the darker themes let you focus more on the characters and text.  The background in A is much too colorful and distracts from the characters.
2042,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,Arcade; Adventure; Action,,"I like these interfaces based on their designs, icons, and overall layout"
2043,Female,$0-30k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Adventure; Arcade; Simulation; Strategy,,"I liked the more blue tones used for option C it just looked nicer. I also liked the top/home page look the most. It looked very dream like. Option A, I thought the home page stood out more with the brighter cool tone colors over the warm tone look of option B."
2044,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Action; Adventure; Racing; Sports; Role Playing,,I like the option that i chose first because the theme of it is dark and dragons are usually out in the dark making me feel more interested in this option
2045,Female,$0-30k,Asian,Graduate Degree,25-34,Action; Adventure; Sports; Simulation; Role Playing,,I thought B's font and color scheme was too dull and muted. I liked that the colors were brighter and lighter in A and appreciated how much the text popped against the graphics.
2046,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,Casino; Puzzle,,"I think option A looks the nicest out of the three, I like the slightly more detailed background."
2047,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Racing; Arcade; Board; Adventure; Action,,This color scheme using the more cool colors really has a nice mystique to it that the others do not as it fits the theme and style of games best because it creates a mood.
2048,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,Sports; Trivia; Music; Puzzle,,I chose option A.  I really like the lighter colors such as the blue and green.
2049,Male,$61-100k,Asian,Graduate Degree,35-44,Casino; Simulation; Adventure; Trivia; Sports,,"Love the blue background used in option C. That looks best and most fun. Option A is great too and has a lot of mystery and intrigue for this world. I like option A a lot but it feels more serious with the design. That said, all of these could work. I'd go with option C or A first for the design. The game feels the most fun between options C and A with the font style and icons used."
2050,Female,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Trivia; Word; Board; Card; Casino,,I really like B out of these options. The use of the dark and shadowy colors and tones work well and I prefer the font.
2051,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,35-44,Casino; Adventure; Arcade; Action; Role Playing,,I think these particular color schemes work best with the magic theme of the game.
2052,Female,$0-30k,Black,Graduate Degree,35-44,Adventure; Arcade; Puzzle; Role Playing; Simulation,,"When I think of a world that is based off  magic, I think of bright colors and this option brings that to my attention. I like that it__ not so bright you think it__ for kids only, it gives it some happiness which many associates with magic, but it also gives a bit of the darkness as well."
2053,Male,$0-30k,White,High School,25-34,Arcade; Card; Educational; Strategy; Puzzle,,The orange background for the UI and look is sleek and on point for this application seen in choice B here
2054,Male,$101k+,Black,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Role Playing,,I like option A the most due to the colorfulness of the layout and icons.
2055,Female,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Role Playing; Word; Simulation; Arcade; Action,,"B is definitely my favourite. The font is attractive and easy to read in the larger and smaller sections. The game logo looks really cool! I like the way the UI is designed a bit more in C, but B wins on the font, colors, logo and overall feel. I didn't like A as much because it looked too familiar, I couldn't pinpoint what game it reminded me of, but it was something."
2056,Female,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,45-54,Simulation; Word; Card; Adventure; Puzzle,,"I chose B first because I like the dark, brooding colors of the layout. It seems foreboding. I also thought the font was better than C because although the font in C is very attractive, it's almost like what most other fantasy genre fonts are, so it's maybe a little bit too expected. I actually preferred the font used in A the most out of all of them, though, because it is a little more unique and thicker, so it goes with the kind of heaviness of the journey and of the magic animal in the second frame. I loved how there is a dragon's eye in the title in A. I chose A over C because of the font style, primarily, but also because I prefer the top frame in A, where it shows the title but a blurred background. It's more focused on the title, and it being blurred in the background suggests that the viewer could go in and get right involved in that scene. It makes it seem like the ""fight"" or journey is already ongoing, which is exciting."
2057,Male,$61-100k,Asian,Graduate Degree,25-34,Strategy; Simulation,,"I gave the rankings based on the first screenshot, which includes the game name and the background."
2058,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,25-34,Puzzle; Adventure; Arcade; Action; Role Playing,,"A matches all around. The logo looks like it matches the style of the dragon. B looks close too. The font is a cool color. C just seems overly done. It doesn't look that great and I don't like the color scheme, even though I love blue."
2059,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,25-34,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Racing; Simulation,,I love option A the most because it best shows what you selected for your strategy and it is the most aesthetically pleasing.
2060,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,45-54,Trivia; Sports; Racing; Puzzle; Action,,"I prefer the background color in B and A, looks more interesting and real."
2061,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,Card; Board; Racing; Puzzle; Adventure,,The interface design was in double combination color it will enhance the look of Game play . The fonts and layout was looking very vivid and perfect in the option A . The gameplay webpage was  looking very clear in all the aspects .
2062,Female,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Arcade; Puzzle; Trivia; Word; Educational,,"My eyes went straight to the middle row for all of them. I like the font and style, and design of A the best, C, second best, and B third."
2063,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Adventure; Simulation; Puzzle,,I usually need large fonts to read easy and also blue helps a lot and thise one reminds me of dota which I like  alot
2064,Male,$0-30k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Board; Card,,I prefer choice A is visually appealing. I choose this because it stands out well.
2065,Male,$0-30k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Action; Adventure; Strategy; Arcade; Sports,,"I pick C, Because I like the the interface and the background which is suitable for the game."
2066,Male,$31-60k,Black,Associate Degree,35-44,Sports; Arcade; Action,,B just was clearer and easier to see compared to the other choices.
2067,Female,$0-30k,Black,Associate Degree,25-34,Trivia; Word; Puzzle,,"I think overall A got my pick because it was the easiest to read the font, I also felt like the orange on a and B were more inviting"
2068,Male,$31-60k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Role Playing; Strategy,,I would go with option A because to me it looks the most challenging and exciting. Option C and B look decent but do not really intrigue me as much overall.
2069,Female,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Action; Card; Educational; Family,,I like B the most because I feel that the redder background gives the character itself more focus since there is more contrast there
2070,Female,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Puzzle,,I chose option A because the details in the game are easiest to see.  I like that the background is clear and the colors are engaging.
2071,Female,$0-30k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Word; Trivia; Simulation; Puzzle; Arcade,,"I picked B because the background color provides the best contrast and makes the graphics/words easiest to see, followed by A and then C."
2072,Male,$0-30k,White,High School,35-44,Adventure; Casino; Puzzle; Role Playing; Word,,"I really can't help but see the light blue colors more than anything, though I do like the buttons on my first choice as well as the color.  I think perhaps the styles of the buttons on the second choice perhaps fits the game better for some people maybe, but I still prefer my first choice strongly."
2073,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Role Playing; Educational; Strategy; Puzzle; Board,,"Option C looked like the most ""mature"" option in that it didn't look like it was totally made for adolescences; the background was a little darker and the facial expressions were more serious. Both B and A seemed more childish in the facial expressions of the characters. I put B higher than A since the pictures of the face were a bit bigger and allowed to see more detail."
2074,Male,$101k+,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Sports; Board; Puzzle,,I prefer option A because it is brighter and more vibrant and portrays a more typical fantasy world.
2075,Female,$31-60k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Sports; Puzzle; Family; Card; Adventure,,"The background color,the way the icons displayed and the font size are awesome.perfect match for the game"
2076,Female,$61-100k,Other,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,Puzzle; Strategy; Educational,,I prefer A because the interface is quite clear and I like the fact that what the game is all about is embolden so it's clear to see an d the fonts used correspond to the whole color scheme of how the game is portrayed. C is next  because although there is not much clarity of the picture the title of the game is quite obvious for all to see and the font used for the name of the game gives it a creative edge and B is last  because the game is too uni-color and the name of the game is in too small a font.
2077,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Word,,"C is the most mysterious and enticing. A feels too much like, well, a video game, its color scheme is more like a toy."
2078,Male,$31-60k,White,Associate Degree,25-34,Role Playing; Puzzle; Sports; Strategy; Action,,"I think option A is clearly the best, I think it's better because it is a background that features world elements instead of a solid color with some elements of the world kind of hidden behind the colors. I think Option A has beautiful scenic shots of the world while the others are lacking because of the color scheme, I also think the UI on the bottommost screen of option A looks the cleanest because the items stand out much better against the dark background whereas for example in option C on the bottom screen they are somewhat hard to see. therefore all things considered I would say Option A is clearly the best layout and design."
2079,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,25-34,Trivia; Sports; Casino; Card; Action,,I like Option C.  Lighter blue colors make it easier to see the inventory. Looks more clean.
2080,Female,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,25-34,Word; Strategy; Sports; Puzzle,,I prefer option B and C because the icons are larger and easier to view. I prefer option B over C because I like that the text feels like ti fits into the scene of the background.
2081,Female,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Adventure; Puzzle; Strategy,,i think it has the most fantastical fonts and themes. i enjoy the colors and how aesthetic the title is
2082,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,Word; Trivia,,My favorite shows three different shades of light across the three panels of the game.  I think this speaks to greater variety and a great investment in having different worlds in the game itself.  The other two panels are more neutral in color palette and look muddy. This simple look is probably a detriment to the investment in the game and it's levels.
2083,Female,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Action; Adventure; Family; Strategy; Music,,I think the UI style of Option A fits this game the best out of the options given.
2084,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Adventure; Role Playing; Simulation; Strategy; Trivia,,I chose the designs based on the color schene
2085,Male,$31-60k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Role Playing; Simulation; Strategy; Arcade; Adventure,,"C- this is has very appealing background and the theme of the game , moreover the character seems to be realistic A- this has unique interface where it has a classic way design which is very much good looking to the theme of the game B- this seems to be legit and simple design"
2086,Male,$0-30k,Hispanic,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Sports; Adventure; Action,,B I feel does the best job with its color scheme and how it meshes with the design.
2087,Female,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Puzzle; Music; Trivia; Educational; Word,,"I will start by saying that this definitely not my general area of interest -- but C is my first choice because the design actually DOES make me somewhat interested in it. I like the use of color here and how it looks kind of ""hazy"" (but still clear). This one ""looks"" the most like an intriguing fantasy to me.I'm not as interested in A and B, though they're alright. I slightly prefer A to B because it's more colorful and I think looks more modern.So B is my third choice, due to the color (or lack thereof) and somewhat ""dated"" look (or, at least, more so than the other two options)."
2088,Male,$0-30k,White,High School,45-54,Strategy; Card; Arcade; Adventure,,This option is easier to read and easier to understand that you can select different sections on the left to display in the middle.
2089,Female,$31-60k,White,High School,45-54,Word; Trivia; Racing; Board; Arcade,,I chose option A because it seems to be more colorful and descriptive with the fonts.
2090,Male,$101k+,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Puzzle; Board; Card; Strategy; Trivia,,I ranked my choices based on my preference for the style of the logo and for the color palette used.
2091,Female,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Card; Family; Strategy; Puzzle; Educational,,"I don't like the tiny little font of the opening title screen of Option B. It is way too small with not enough contrast to be noticeable at all. PLus the whole thing has a dark feel so it is unremarkable. Option A is great because the title screen has action going on with vibrant colors but the actual play screen is dark with a lot of contrast to see what you are doing. Option C is okay, but I don't like the light coloring on the tool action screen."
2092,Male,$0-30k,Other,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Role Playing; Puzzle,,These all look good. I like C and A more though because they are big tanks. E has a nice futuristic look to them. B is very unique with the legs. D is also fine and has legs.
2093,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,Casino; Puzzle,,"I think option C is a very solid fortress design, it looks very much like a classic sci fi machine."
2094,Male,$0-30k,Hispanic,High School,25-34,Role Playing; Adventure; Action,,"I really love the train aesthetic on option E so it's my number one. Options C and A seem too generic for me so I'll rank them last. Option D beats out option B by not looking like a bug, but still looking pleasant. Option C is a bit off putting with it's bug look, but it's definitely ahead than a tank design."
2095,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,45-54,Trivia; Sports; Racing; Puzzle; Action,,The fortresses in option C and A looks strong and would be hard to penetrate. I like the designs too.
2096,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Sports; Strategy; Arcade; Adventure; Action,,i like the fortress in option D the most because it looks gargantuan and futuristic to me
2097,Male,$31-60k,White,Associate Degree,25-34,Role Playing; Puzzle; Sports; Strategy; Action,,"I think Option D is clearly the best, I like option D so much because it almost looks like it could be a moving city on the inside, it looks so massive and looks like there could be so much going on inside of the fortress that it makes me very curious and excited. It also has very interesting structures on the top of it that make it seem like you could walk around up top while it is moving around. I also believe it has better dimensions then the other options I think some of the others are too narrow or to high off the ground therefore all things considered I would select Option D without a doubt."
2098,Male,$0-30k,Hispanic,Vocational Training,25-34,Strategy; Role Playing; Action,,"Option B is very cool and unique, love the 6 legs, reminds me of an insect"
2099,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Arcade; Casino; Puzzle; Sports; Word,,D looks like helipad.  It reminds me of the one in Avengers that SHIELD had.  It looks cool and like it can defend whatever it needs to
2100,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,Family; Puzzle; Action; Role Playing; Strategy,,"B makes little sense, mechanical legs are usually vulnerable things that are easily destroyed or damaged. E and C just look like big tanks and not fortresses. D is a decent representation of what I would anticipate given the description but A is the ideal."
2101,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Adventure; Music; Puzzle; Strategy; Educational,,This option looks the most agile and quick but also maybe a bit vulnerable.  I want to be a brawn but still have the ability to move around quickly.
2102,Male,$61-100k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Strategy; Role Playing,,I liked choice A since the design reminds me of an aircraft carrier. Choice A has a more solid design which is closer to the ground. Choice B looks too tall and is stood up by stilts which isn't too strong.
2103,Male,$0-30k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Adventure; Puzzle; Action; Strategy; Board,,"I really like the idea of something big and blocky, making it more realistic. An industrial look makes it more engaging and interesting to look at as well."
2104,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Arcade; Strategy; Trivia; Role Playing; Simulation,,"Option B stands out the most because of the ""legs"" that it has to move, which is different than the others in a positive way. Option D is ranked second due to the large amount of detail present in it. Option C is ranked last because it reminds me of a tank too much."
2105,Male,$61-100k,White,Associate Degree,35-44,Puzzle; Trivia,,I like option B because the fortress has more detail and a futuristic look.
2106,Male,$101k+,Black,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Sports; Racing; Puzzle; Adventure; Action,,I would choose choice B first because of my love for robots and since the weapon am using in this case looks like a robot I would choose it first then go to choice A because it shows the various weapons which I will be using and how they can be dissembled then go to choice C because the weapon I will be using looks really strong and well build so it gives me more confidence while playing the game. D will be the next choice because of the moving weapons look really sophisticated and give one a sense of confidence while they are playing the game. The last option will be E because the image does not really show how the whole looks like and it does not create a sense of confidence in the play.
2107,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Racing; Action,,It looks strong and massive
2108,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,25-34,Card; Role Playing; Simulation; Music; Strategy,,Option B looks the most appealing to me. It looks a little bit like a spider which is cool.
2109,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Adventure; Board; Card; Casino,,I like choice A is because its a flatter fortress and uses the more realistic version of tracks system to move it.  The other ideas seem more far fetch.
2110,Male,$101k+,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Arcade; Casino; Card; Trivia; Role Playing,,I voted based on which one looked the strongest most defensible and ability to move
2111,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Trivia; Card; Casino; Sports,,I like the moving city look to it. I'm definitely we wanna play something like this
2112,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,35-44,Simulation; Puzzle; Card; Board; Adventure,,"It is detailed, has countless different features, and has many hidden areas that could be used for gameplay"
2113,Male,$31-60k,Asian,Graduate Degree,25-34,Trivia; Strategy; Simulation; Role Playing; Action,,"I choose B because I can see all angles and aspects of the design which is visually attractive and unique, compared to other options"
2114,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Racing; Arcade; Board; Adventure; Action,,This design is more grand in scale and very intimidating in a way that would make this much more fitting for this description. It also looks like it could carry more soldiers and offer better protection.
2115,Male,$0-30k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Role Playing; Strategy,,Options C and E look like forces can deploy from multiple sites.
2116,Male,$61-100k,Black,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Adventure; Action; Role Playing; Strategy; Simulation,,I like option A the best because I like the long slender look of the fortress.
2117,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Arcade; Simulation; Strategy,,I like option B because the moving fortress actually has legs. It count be more limber and faster than what appears to be wheels of a military tank.
2118,Male,$31-60k,Black,Associate Degree,25-34,Music; Family; Casino; Board,,I love robotic movements
2119,Male,$0-30k,White,High School,25-34,Action; Adventure; Puzzle; Word; Music,,"A, I find the details and the tracked vehicle makes me feel much more interested, it would provide a smooth movement. The details of fortress also looks very detailed and it makes me much more interested.C, I find the tracked vehicle makes me think the movement would be smooth, and the fortress looks detailed well that makes me feel interested.E, this fortress looks very comfortable, the tracks would provide a smooth movement, and the fortress details look very smooth, it hides many of the rooms and details and it makes me think of a hospital or upper class building.D, the tracks and overall details look a little rough, and it makes me think the movement and protection might be a little poor.B, I don't like the idea of a mobile fortress using legs to move, while it interests me, I am worried that the fortress movement would be rough and potentially shake or be a rough ride for people on board."
2120,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Adventure; Strategy; Role Playing,,The one with legs seems impractical.  All the other ones that mostly look like large tanks are pretty equal to me.
2121,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Sports; Role Playing; Arcade; Adventure; Action,,"Option D is the most appealing among the choices. The fortress looks well designed, fortified, and very detailed. It has a unique look, and something that would be more memorable. It looks well layered."
2122,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Word; Puzzle; Strategy; Adventure; Action,,"i  like the bigness of it, it looks big and itimidating , powerful and yet imposing"
2123,Male,$101k+,White,Associate Degree,35-44,Sports; Casino; Simulation; Arcade; Action,,"I chose A for my first option because it shows the different parts separately. It's able to show what the different parts look like as they're moving, as opposed to the other choices that are already put together. I ranked the other choices accordingly."
2124,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Adventure; Casino; Music; Sports,,"Options C and E, in that order, are my preferred choices for a moving fortress because the tracks remind me of a tank configuration which allows it to move with speed and to navigate very difficult terrain when necessary."
2125,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Trivia; Puzzle; Educational; Board; Action,,"the colors aren't that pretty on any of them, it makes it a bit hard to see. when you zoom in though they aren't bad, but either completely gray scale, or completely in color would make it easier. the sepia is odd in this case. i think that my 1, 2 and 3 all have a nice view. i prefer the ones in 1 and 3 over 2, but two i think just the angle makes the main image a bit hard to see. 4 is nice because you have an all around feel to it. 5 is okay, but harder to see."
2126,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,35-44,Action; Adventure; Role Playing; Simulation; Strategy,,"B and E I like equally, the look cool and unique in their design . A.C. and D comes look like a GI Joe vehicle and just does not come off as massive and powerful as the first 2 options do"
2127,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Action; Adventure; Strategy; Trivia; Word,,"I think C looks cool and jumped out at me as looking like a mobile fortress. I sort of reminded me of the Jawa fortress from Star Wars. I feel like it looks the part, so C is my favorite"
2128,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Adventure; Trivia; Music; Sports,,"I chose the options that looked the most sturdy and not easily toppled. They are all pretty good options, but I wanted the bigger, broader options first."
2129,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,45-54,Action; Educational; Adventure; Arcade; Strategy,,I chose E because it is smooth and harder for enemies to climb it.  I chose C next because it looks like a dominant tank.  B A and D were about equal to me from there.
2130,Male,$61-100k,White,High School,25-34,Music,,I chose c first because that mobile base looks by f a r the coolest. My other choices were based off of how they looked and how I did my process of eliminating
2131,Male,$0-30k,Hispanic,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Sports; Adventure; Action,,D I feel is a very unique design to the fortress that makes it more appealing and interesting to me.
2132,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,45-54,Adventure; Casino; Music; Sports,,My like and reason for the choices i made and decided
2133,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Casino; Adventure; Strategy,,"I like thick, block textures as you can focus on color scheme than intricate design that isn't practical and is easily attacked on the legs"
2134,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Adventure; Simulation; Puzzle,,The simplicity mixed with how realistic the structure looks makes me think of the expanse or other near future sci fi
2135,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Casino; Puzzle; Trivia,,I feel both C and E look like they don't have much for defense and look like a less stable fortress. I like the more pyramid shape of d and the different things attached to it. A and B look like they have less mobility than D but do also feature a lot on the outside of it that is attractive.
2136,Male,$31-60k,Black,Associate Degree,35-44,Arcade; Racing; Role Playing; Action; Adventure,,"I ranked the choices by how futuristic I felt the the images were.  Options A, B, and C look like what I would expect a futuristic mobile fortress to look.  Option E looks like a train, and option D seems a little too busy for my liking."
2137,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Casino; Puzzle; Sports,,"I prefer the futuristic look of Option E, and how it is shaped in a way that makes the interior a bit more ambiguous in terms of design. I also like Option D because it seems like a large fortress, whereas C, A, and B all feel more like weaker tanks and vehicles compared to the other options."
2138,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,Card; Board; Racing; Puzzle; Adventure,,The option D has the good design structure . It will offers the consumer to do more installations and sharing with others . They will give first preference to these type of theme based games . They will definitely choose these type of games .
2139,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Strategy; Puzzle; Adventure,,I like the design of option C as it looks the most capable. I think it looks like it could move the best and be the most agile in case of an attack.
2140,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,Strategy; Simulation; Role Playing,,"The tracks are large enough that it is believable the fortress would be able to move under the tremendous weight. On the other tracked images, the tracks themselves are too small to be believable. The option with legs is totally unbelievable."
2141,Male,$31-60k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Role Playing; Simulation; Strategy; Arcade; Adventure,,"D-you can find these strongholds, each with its unique featuresC- this is kind of cool to have one since it has spaceship like designA- This seems to be very well crafted and has unique look and moreover it seemingly looks interesting E- Its body structure and design is very slick and plain , simple to look which is greatB- Its like a animal or insect like design which makes it flexible to move around"
2142,Male,$0-30k,Other,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Role Playing; Puzzle,,A is more of a standard looking desert setting while B is that but also seems more interesting because of the foliage.
2143,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,Casino; Puzzle,,I chose option A because the redder image looks a little more ominous and exciting.
2144,Male,$0-30k,Hispanic,Less than High School Diploma,25-34,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Role Playing; Simulation,,I like this because it has a post apocalyptic view to it seems like a baron wasteland. Making it a game I would play because of that alone.
2145,Male,$0-30k,Hispanic,High School,25-34,Role Playing; Adventure; Action,,"Definitely option B just by it's nicer looking colors, also I'm seeing a bit more variety in its colors than A. To me option B makes the world look more alienish than A."
2146,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Role Playing; Adventure; Sports; Strategy; Trivia,,"B. B has a more modern/futuristic spaceship type theme, which seems more fitting for a game revolving around a moving fortress, as opposed to the more fantasy/castle theme shown in A."
2147,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Sports; Strategy; Arcade; Adventure; Action,,i like the atmosphere in option B the most because it looks ominous and very fantasy-like
2148,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,45-54,Trivia; Sports; Racing; Puzzle; Action,,The atmosphere in option A looks more real.
2149,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,Family; Puzzle; Action; Role Playing; Strategy,,A seems dirty and gritty which better suits it to the world in which I imagine this vehicle operating.
2150,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Arcade; Casino; Puzzle; Sports; Word,,A looks more dangerous and like a battlefield
2151,Male,$0-30k,Hispanic,Vocational Training,25-34,Strategy; Role Playing; Action,,"Option A looks more run down and dystopian, sort of like a ghetto/village with a castle in the middle, I think it is more interesting."
2152,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Arcade; Strategy; Trivia; Role Playing; Simulation,,"The blue color makes the environment seem more ""alive"" in Option B."
2153,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Adventure; Music; Puzzle; Strategy; Educational,,This atmosphere feels a little more dynamic with a great mixture of blue and red.  I like Option A less because of its higher concentration of the red color.
2154,Male,$0-30k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Adventure; Puzzle; Action; Strategy; Board,,"Having cities and ruins around makes the world feel more alive, and slightly tragic. I helps immerse me way more into the game, making it more engaging."
2155,Male,$101k+,Black,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Sports; Racing; Puzzle; Adventure; Action,,I would go for choice B first simply because of the blue portion of the surface which gives the game a better clearance to play the game as compared to choice A which has a brown color which reduces the ground visibility.
2156,Male,$61-100k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Strategy; Role Playing,,I liked choice A since the barren wasteland looks more relatable to the theme of the game. Choice B isn't as appealing and doesn't look as relevant.
2157,Male,$61-100k,White,Associate Degree,35-44,Puzzle; Trivia,,I like option A because the image is clearer and has more detail.
2158,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,25-34,Card; Role Playing; Simulation; Music; Strategy,,I think Option B has more appealing colors used in the landscape.
2159,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Racing; Action,,It looks like a reddish planet
2160,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Adventure; Board; Card; Casino,,It looks like a more advanced fortress and the rounded shape of the front is more aerodynamic.
2161,Male,$101k+,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Arcade; Casino; Card; Trivia; Role Playing,,Both are very similar but B looks a little bit more like harsh environment
2162,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,35-44,Simulation; Puzzle; Card; Board; Adventure,,It looks more realistic and almost is comparable to the pictures that you see from the Mars rover.
2163,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Trivia; Card; Casino; Sports,,I like the desert look. I think it be fun to play a game like this. Aesthetics are really nice and cool looking
2164,Male,$31-60k,Asian,Graduate Degree,25-34,Trivia; Strategy; Simulation; Role Playing; Action,,I prefer B over A because B is more attractive and appealing visual effects than A
2165,Male,$0-30k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Role Playing; Strategy,,Option B looks more futuristic and has more capabilities.
2166,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Racing; Arcade; Board; Adventure; Action,,This design seems far more imposing and large in scale in a manner that would make this seem better for protection but also carry more weaponry and soldiers
2167,Male,$101k+,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Adventure; Puzzle,,I prefer A because the environment seems more like a desert wasteland and a moveable object like this aligns with this type of environment.
2168,Male,$61-100k,Black,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Adventure; Action; Role Playing; Strategy; Simulation,,I like option A the best because this is how I would envision a ravished landscape to look like as well as how the moving fortress would look like where it collected things during the travels and would have these things sitting on the deck for people to survive.
2169,Male,$31-60k,Black,Associate Degree,25-34,Music; Family; Casino; Board,,This onis clearer
2170,Male,$0-30k,White,High School,25-34,Action; Adventure; Puzzle; Word; Music,,"I find the overall theme and details to make me feel more post apocalyptic, which makes me very interested in the setting and the environment. There is a lot of small details that make me feel interested."
2171,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Adventure; Strategy; Role Playing,,"Well, being more ship shaped make it seem more movable."
2172,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Word; Puzzle; Strategy; Adventure; Action,,"it feels less alien, yet still imposing and dreary, not a happy place"
2173,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Trivia; Puzzle; Educational; Board; Action,,"i like both of these, but these colors seem a bit richer, although you can't see the ¿beach? as well"
2174,Male,$101k+,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Word; Strategy; Role Playing; Adventure; Action,,"For a moving fortress game, I would default to A as in my mind, any moving fortress game has a hellscape type environment and the reddish-orange landscape would match that in my head. The greener colors in B look like a nicer environment from a quick glance however I do see the craters and maybe pollution in it. It's much harder to notice though."
2175,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Adventure; Casino; Music; Sports,,I prefer this environment and atmosphere for such a game because this moving fortress has huge tracks on the bottom that remind me of tanks that would allow it to move over any terrain and at decent speed on a flat battlefield.
2176,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,35-44,Action; Adventure; Role Playing; Simulation; Strategy,,"this looks better the other seems to be less clear somehow like it blends in with the background, Option A stands out to me and looks more vivid"
2177,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Action; Adventure; Strategy; Trivia; Word,,I like B. Its more colorful and brighter. It has more detail and just seems more alive
2178,Male,$0-30k,Hispanic,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Sports; Adventure; Action,,B has a more interesting setting that I feel has a better design to it.
2179,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,45-54,Action; Educational; Adventure; Arcade; Strategy,,I chose A because it looks reddish in the atmosphere which makes me think that this is Mars and we are habitating and fighting aliens.
2180,Male,$31-60k,Black,Associate Degree,35-44,Arcade; Racing; Role Playing; Action; Adventure,,"Option A has more of an industrial look to it, which I would better associate with a moving fortress."
2181,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,45-54,Adventure; Casino; Music; Sports,,Love the product  better and concept
2182,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Adventure; Simulation; Puzzle,,"I like the ominous red look, it looks post apocalyptic"
2183,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,Card; Board; Racing; Puzzle; Adventure,,I like the game app in the Option A . Because in the option A the fortress was looking great and theme effect was good . The game will be create a eagerness to play it repeatedly .
2184,Male,$61-100k,Asian,Graduate Degree,35-44,Casino; Simulation; Adventure; Trivia; Sports,,The red kingdom for the fortress looks more desolate and powerful. This seems like the last fort standing. That has more appeal here if you ask me.
2185,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Strategy; Puzzle; Adventure,,I like option B because option A looks clunky and not the most functional. I think option B is much more agile.
2186,Male,$0-30k,White,High School,45-54,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Role Playing; Strategy,,"I like A, it has more of a conquering/conquest type setting and the fortress has more of a battle vibe."
2187,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Casino; Puzzle; Trivia,,I like that B has more vegetation and more interesting landscape with the crater in the background.
2188,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,25-34,Action; Casino; Arcade; Trivia,,"I like that there is a little more color in the image in option B, it doesn't seem as barren and desolate."
2189,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,25-34,Word; Strategy; Trivia,,"I liked the style of A more because it seems more desolate and intimidating, which is a good fit for the atmosphere of this type of game."
2190,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Puzzle; Sports; Strategy,,I prefer A because it looks more desolate and like the place a moving fortress would land.  It looks like there have been many battles there.
2191,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,45-54,Puzzle; Sports; Arcade; Adventure; Action,,The atmosphere looks so real and interesting.
2192,Male,$0-30k,Other,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,H and E are the cutest ones. It is cats in a way I have never seen them before. B and C are also kind of new and fresh. The rest either don't stand out too much or have been done before like G which is an Egyptian cat.
2193,Female,$0-30k,Asian,Graduate Degree,25-34,,,"I liked the options that had lighter, brighter colored cats with more refreshing background hues since these felt more rejuvenating than the options that featured gloomy, dark and heavy colors."
2194,Female,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,25-34,,,"I honestly don't understand what the pictures and descriptions have anything to do with the question you want answered, but I think H has a cute picture of a cat on it and in our house- our cat is def. treated like royalty. I do think cats play a huge part in our world though. Cats are easier to take care of and independent. I think cats make the world a better place because it teaches us there's more than just us on this planet to worry about. Cats make people happy."
2195,Female,$0-30k,White,Less than High School Diploma,35-44,,,They are trained in the art in battle. They grew up in privileged families and disliked they had so much privilege and opportunities than others. They decided to change the system.
2196,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,,,"Again, these are all great concepts.  I like option H, I love his expression and I quite like the concept of a cat king."
2197,Female,$31-60k,Hispanic,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,,,"I like option C best because I love the whole wizard thing. He's a little different than the typical wizard, so I like him best. Next comes option B with your more stereotypical wizard dude. Then there's option E. I really like this guy a lot. I'm kind of torn - I almost want to make him first, but I still love wizards so I'll leave him in this spot. He's so interesting though. He's got all this kind of alchemy-steampunk stuff going on. He looks fun! Then there's option A. This little guy definitely looks ready for adventure. After that comes option D. He seems a little out of place, but the artwork is supercool. He looks bad ass! Don't care for the smoking though, not in this day and age. Then comes option F - and who doesn't love a pirate. Definite has Jack Sparrow vibes. Then there's option H. This dude already looks like he's king, so I'm a little confused by him here. He looks great though. Finally with option G, not caring for the sort of sexualized cat thing going on here. I'm sure guys will love it, but as a woman, not so much."
2198,Female,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,I really like the cat that is standing tall and proud. I also like the cat that looks like a pirate. the other choices are okay since the description describes a curious world which is fitting to cats. I don't like the last option since it looks like a cat.
2199,Female,$0-30k,White,High School,35-44,,,Option B is my favorite end of the roll I think they will play or this one will place I suspect it will be like lord of the rings type of same because of the cat looking like Gandolf the gray and I suspect that this character would be very mysterious and very powerful as well I love these they're absolutely awesome I'm really impressed
2200,Male,$0-30k,White,High School,25-34,,,Ranked by realism mixed with contrast
2201,Male,$61-100k,White,Associate Degree,35-44,,,I like option D because the character looks the most approachable.
2202,Female,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,I like that these images are different
2203,Female,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,The cat that is dressed as a king is adorable and fits the description more than the rest. He reminds me of those portraits you can get of your own pet that are put on different bodies dressed in royal clothing.
2204,Male,$31-60k,Asian,High School,35-44,,,I chose A as the best because it shows the cat being valiant and the flag makes it feel as if they are fighting to keep their nation alive.  I think the cats are trying to stop invading forces from driving them out of their homelands
2205,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,25-34,,,"Option A gives you that starting vibe that you're going to get as a starting adventurer, and I really like that. C, D, B, E, and G all look like what your character becomes after gaining enough power. These all look like different classes for a fantasy RPG. I think F misses the mark a little bit. It seems like a goofy picture that made its way into this group, but the idea of being a pirate isn't too far fetched in my opinion. H definitely sells the idea of a cat being King, but it isn't a great picture to go with in my opinion. As this one also looks very silly."
2206,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,45-54,,,"THe style in option C possess the 'adventure' look. The style in H portrays the character of a loving and powerful king, one his subjects would gladly follow."
2207,Female,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,My choice is option a as rank 1 because of the character design and the concept is very nice and attractive in the game as a curiosity so i choose this as my choice all other character this is very unique.
2208,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,,,"I chose option B first because I like the wizard cat creature shown in this image the most and think it would guide a group of non-player characters to challenge the oppressive regime of warriors in this game. I chose option E second because I like how this cat looks smart and technologically minded and think it would build impressive robots and contraptions to fight against the big bad in this fantasy adventure. I chose option F third because this cat looks swift, fast and cunning like Jack Sparrow and has a nice outfit that looks cool, which means I think this cat would fight alone against the enemies in this fantasy world. I chose option D fourth because I like the tough look and weapon this cat is carrying, which would come in handy when fighting the bad guys in this fantasy world. I chose options C, A and G fifth, sixth and seventh because I like the book reading cat, small cat warrior, Cleopatra-like cat much less than the wizard and technologically proficient cats, which suggests these cats would only play minor roles in this fantasy world. I chose option H last because I do not like the regal king cat at all, and I think the option H cat's reign would be short and rough in this game."
2209,Female,$0-30k,White,High School,25-34,,,"While I don't like any of them, I chose Option B because it looks like it would fit the role of trying to become a humble king. I just wish it were more feminine looking for a king as I like the idea of a girl king for a change. Thanks!"
2210,Male,$61-100k,Black,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,"I think Option C looks like the best representation out of the eight choices. Option C's illustration is really the only image that matches the tone of the description. Option's E and A are also decent, but Option C is the best out of the choices given."
2211,Male,$0-30k,Hispanic,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,I feel that D has the best design and it meshes well with the description that is given.
2212,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,C and B are powerful wozards.  They will lead the mission of warriors (like characters D and A) on a quest to save the world as we know it.
2213,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,45-54,,,The pictures and description of the cats are really adorable and interesting.
2214,Female,$0-30k,Black,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,i believe that my top three choices fit the description and the others fit the fantasy world of cats
2215,Female,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,I like the older wise cat. It seems more unique and playful which I like.
2216,Male,$0-30k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,"I pick B, because the cat in these image is a Swordsman and more suitable for a concept in this game and I think he is suited to be a King and gather some army through his adventures and Quest to get his fame high and be more respectable through his achievements that's why I pick this choice. And the others is like an bandit, mage, Gunner, Noble, Engineer, and a summoner so that's my idea on this concepts game."
2217,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,35-44,,,"The cat is old, wise, and has seen many things on his quest to become king. He is full of wisdom and great stories to tell."
2218,Male,$61-100k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,I liked choice B since the wizard looks the most confident and relatable to the story line. Choice E looks too big and not as intelligent or smart.
2219,Male,$31-60k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,,,"The cat with the yellow flag in my top choice looks bold and brave, which is appealing. The cat with the staff in my second choice looks wise. Overall it's a nice set of designs for sure!"
2220,Male,$61-100k,Black,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,I like option C the best because I like how the cat character is dressed and the cat looks like they are intelligent judging my things they have with them.  I also think that they have a super power that they can use to summon with their staff.
2221,Female,$31-60k,White,Associate Degree,25-34,,,"I picked Option H as my first choice. The cat in the picture is adorable. I think the silly looking cat with its tongue out is the best choice. I would love to play a game where I am this hilarious and cute looking cat and I am dominating the challenges in the game and achieving a higher rank. I picked Option B as my #2 choice. I think the wizard looking cat makes a lot of sense based on the description. It's still cute, but it's more serious than the first choice because the cat looks less silly. The cat makes me feel confident and like I'm on a mission. I picked Option E as my #3 choice. It looks like a steam punk cat to me. I like the ginger color. I think it fits well with the game. I feel like it's a smart and cunning cat. I picked Option D as my #4 choice. I like this choice as well. I think it's an interesting take on the theme of cats in the game. I like that the cat is all stylish and decked out and playing what looks to be a synth. I don't know there's just something very charming about being a smart, cunning adventurous cat who is awesome and can also play cool electronic music. I picked Option F as my #5 choice. I think it looks like a house cat that has been put in a Johnny Depp costume. I think that would fit very well with this type of game. I like that this cat is more humanoid, I think that's an interesting angle on the theme, even if I like the more cat-like, or pet-looking, or cartoon-looking cats as well. I picked Option C as my #6 choice. It's a cool cat as well. So many cool cats! I think it's very cute, especially because it looks like a Persian cat. I like that it looks very precious-looking. I think that makes it more interesting and funnier when the cats look like that because I like the idea of being a cute pet that is beating challenges and taking over a fantasy world. I picked Option G as my #7 choice. This is a very sexy-looking, humanoid cat but in body only, with an Egyptian vibe. It's not my favorite, but I think it's an interesting take. I could see how that kind of cat could fit in with this type of game. I picked Option A as my #8 choice. It looks like a cute little cartoon cat. It's not bad, it's just the least interesting to me. It also makes me feel more like this is a kid's game, rather than a game that is kind of fun in a childlike way but one that would appeal to adults as well."
2222,Female,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,45-54,,,A came from humble beginnings but is ready to form a fellowship of many of the other creatures (especially warriors and wizards) to win the kingdom.
2223,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,35-44,,,"I love the concept of meeting varied charachters, all while being captain jack sparrow"
2224,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,Heavy will play the upper echelon of the fantasy world. Cat at least looks smart and I think that's the role play
2225,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,,,I like all of these they are all very creative and would be fun to meet.the designs are awesome and seem a lot of fun. They are well drawn. My 1 just looks like a badass whoch seems fun I love the wizard too. 2 is an awesome cat and the jewels seem to bring adventure
2226,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,,,"I'd say most of these feel like cat caricatures rather than unique fantasy characters.   They seem to be your standard fantasy heroes, but cats."
2227,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,"I chose option F as my favorite because I like the thought of cats being pirates.  I think it is funny that most cats don't like water, but they would become pirates."
2228,Male,$61-100k,Other,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,"I most prefer option B because of the world that the character takes me to. I feel like the world is very interesting, with many different characters and even having the inclusion of magic."
2229,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,"The character in Option B looks so much like an adventurer and a smart experienced detective who is out to solve mysteries, discover theories and provide answers to the most hidden puzzles and questions on earth, he looks fearful and yet wise and i love this."
2230,Female,$0-30k,White,High School,35-44,,,I love the cat design of Option B; he looks wise and the mysterious. Option C also has a style that is appealing; the cat gives a vibe of being mystical. Option E was unique and creative. Option A looked adventurous and exciting. Option G was a bit too angular and lacked the whimsical quality of earlier choices. Option F was too much of a rip-off of Pirates of the Caribbean. Option D was too militaristic and aggressive. Option H was too boring and pretentious.
2231,Female,$31-60k,White,High School,25-34,,,I like the ones that look like cats. The pirate cat is too much for me. It looks silly.
2232,Female,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,"I prefer the look of option B's cat.  The design is clearly that of a wizard-type cat who will guide the player through these worlds.  I am also strongly attracted to the cat look of option C - older, wiser, with a book to show the way. Great concept."
2233,Male,$0-30k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,Option D of a more technologically advanced character makes it more full of surprises.
2234,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,"This one literally looks like Gandolf.  Due to this association, I would imagine that he would be a wise wizard.  I would like to interact or play as this character due to this as well"
2235,Female,$31-60k,White,Graduate Degree,25-34,,,The magic seeming character is most appealing.
2236,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,"Options C and E, in that order, are the characters that I would prefer because they seem like wise leaders with experience and grit.  Their costumes and bearing fit perfectly with this role in a fantasy world where cats have an important job."
2237,Male,$0-30k,White,Graduate Degree,25-34,,,"I like new characters, not like F which the captain sparrow or G who is just Cleopatra. Option B is also an old character, Gandalf but it really looks cool, if you are reanimating a well know character, at least do it like in option B, not as option F. Option D  and E look like they do not belong to this world."
2238,Male,$61-100k,Hispanic,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,To me this cat look sleek and ready to go into this fantasy world and use their charm and good looks in order to come out on top. It reminds me of queen Cleopatra.
2239,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,I think the cat with a beard is a fun and interesting twist.
2240,Female,$61-100k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,I like that B is a wise wizard and just not a fighting machine. It bucks the stereotypes about cats. I imagine he's the character that characters on new quests seek out for advice. He's seen it all and knows a lot.
2241,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,,,"The Option C , description was clearly explained and the picture of a cat was depicted  very well ,it was looking very cute too . I love to go for the Option C ."
2242,Female,$0-30k,Asian,Graduate Degree,25-34,,,"I liked the options that featured brighter, lighter colors and more youthful and juvenile facial expressions. The options that featured heavier, darker colors just looked a little depressing to me and didn't really inspire any sense of fun or enthusiasm for the game."
2243,Male,$31-60k,White,Associate Degree,25-34,,,"I felt each option besides D was pretty generic-looking. I think Option D showcases a game full of fun, customizability, mystique, and the character pictured looks really cool and I feel will attract the most users to the game."
2244,Male,$0-30k,Other,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,E is the stand out one looking really cool. B and F are also pretty cool B especially having a razor blade as a weapon. A and D are less cute and more hardcore looking. The rest are whatever and don't stand out to me in anyway.
2245,Female,$0-30k,White,Less than High School Diploma,35-44,,,They represent a race of people who don__ want to fight because they have lost faith in the system. They are unsure about your rule but might be persuaded to if show them you are not like the others. They have exceptional and intelligent fighting skills.
2246,Female,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,25-34,,,"People don't really think about rats or mice playing a huge role in our world, but they play a super important role in our lives. Rats & mice balance our ecosystem. People in Africa rely on rats & mice to eat. Rats & mice also play a huge role in the growth of trees. They spread seeds around, which helps with growth of plants and trees."
2247,Female,$31-60k,Hispanic,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,,,"So I picked option D first because it's the most adventurous looking mouse. He looks like he's ready for action. Then there's option A, probably the next best bet for an adventure seeking mouse. After that is option C. Love how this mouse is on a bird. He looks fun. Then there's option F. Definitely looks like there's something brewing here, so I'm curious what's going on. After that is option B. I would have probably liked this dude a bit more if the art was a little more bold. It's very soft looking. Which is ok, but it's a little too soft especially on the black background. Then there's option E, which is kind of a weird looking creature. Is it a mouse? The tail is just crazy long. Still, he looks like he's ready for an adventure. Then there's option H, and this dude would've ranked higher, but the way his face is drawn it feels a little on the creepy side. It's hard to explain, but he feels a little like he's melting. I guess there's not enough detail in him. After that there's option G and I feel like this guy's getting ready to go working on the railroad. Not the most adventurous dude."
2248,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,,,"I just wanted to begin that I love all these concepts.  I chose option B because all the little details, like the repurposed razor blade and the safety pin really add to the idea.  I think this little guy is a reluctant warrior."
2249,Female,$0-30k,White,High School,35-44,,,Option H is definitely my favorite one I prefer and the role that I think that one will play it reminds me of the Lord of the rings theme and I suspect that the character will be much like Gandolf the gray. These characters are so unique and absolutely gorgeous I love this theme and it's actually really incredible I love it.
2250,Male,$61-100k,White,Associate Degree,35-44,,,I like option G and E because the characters look the most friendly and adventerous.
2251,Female,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,I like the imagery and how it looks it stands out
2252,Male,$101k+,Black,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,I would choose choice H first because first of the image that has been made for the description and it looks like a war image and for gamers it is really attractive then I will go for option G which is also has a good image and a good description and it gives one the morale to play the game then I will choose choice C and B which have almost he same image to have a good game and it really gives you the confidence to go and play the game. Then I will go for choice F and A  which has a quite interesting rat image although it is not much of a war like image but it can also play a good role in the gaming aspect and then lastly I would choose choice E and D as the last ones because I find the rat images a bit off for such an interesting game to play with.
2253,Male,$31-60k,Asian,High School,35-44,,,I thought option E was the best as it gave a feeling of being proud and honorable.  I think the game centers around war between rats and mice and having a powerful figure introduce the game makes me feel more alive and heroic.
2254,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,25-34,,,"Option F is my favorite for the description. It's very fitting in that the story is about you traveling, and growing in power. Option F gives you that feeling of adventure, and starting with nothing, but working toward something. Option E, C, B, D and A are all also very great. They're like the next step after F. You could look at any one of these pictures and imagine the mouse in F turning into any one of those options. H and G feel like they miss the mark. H isn't bad, as you could see it as this is what you could become, but G feels out of place and doesn't fit in my opinion."
2255,Female,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,"I love the one that has the mouse standing tall. I Like F and D because they are something that is of a fantasy world, which is intriguing.  A and H kind of look wizardy which is kind of cool it it's own way. C, B and G are all a little boring."
2256,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,45-54,,,"I think the concept in option H is the best for the character. It shows the character to be calm, powerful and ready to seek what is in the world. I feel the concept in D kind of portrays the character to be a drunkard, I love the style anyways."
2257,Female,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,My choice is option D as rank 1 because of the story concept is very much suitable with the character i chooose.In this concept the character is i think smuggler character.
2258,Male,$61-100k,Black,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,"I think Option F looks like the best representation out of the eight choices. Option F's illustration really helps set the tone of the description and it makes it flow naturally. Option's E and A are also suitable in my opinion, but Option F is the best out of the lot."
2259,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,,,"I chose option H first because I like the old mage mouse creature shown in this image the most and think it would distill knowledge and guide a group of non-player characters to challenge the oppressive regime of warriors in this game. I chose option G second because I like how this mouse looks smart like an engineer and technologically minded and think it would build impressive robots and contraptions to fight against the big bad creatures in this fantasy adventure. I chose option A third because this mouse looks swift, fast and cunning like a ranger and stays in the shadows wearing a nice outfit that looks cool, which means I think this cat would fight alone against the enemies in this fantasy world. I chose option E fourth because I like the calm and collected style of this mouse who I think would be able to gather a group of mice to fight against the enemy in this fantasy world. I chose options B, C and F fifth, sixth and seventh because I like the razor blade weapon carrying mouse, the bird riding mouse, and more gruff green cloaked rat much less than the smarter and technologically proficient mice, which suggests these cats would only play minor roles in this fantasy world like a scout or messenger for the bird riding mouse. I chose option D last because I do not like this greedy rat character at all with the gold and he looks like a bad guy rat."
2260,Female,$0-30k,White,High School,25-34,,,"Option C I think is the best choice, it looks like their role would be to get everyone together, of all creatures, it looks like much more fun to play than the other options, more adventurous looking too! Thank you!"
2261,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,"A and H are very appealing.  Character a reminds me of Gandolph, a powerful wizard who is ready to lead. H also reminds me of a magical, wizard type character. With his bird ready to spy on people and do his bidding"
2262,Male,$0-30k,Hispanic,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,"I feel that A's design is very intriguing, and looks really well to draw my interest. It also meshes well with the description that is given."
2263,Male,$0-30k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,"I pick C, Because the image on B, is more suitable for the concepts of the game which is by making an army and becoming a kind the image really suits well for a concepts more appealing and more brave and courageous and more a King for me. And for the other images they fit well in other jobs because of the photo I think of their concept not becoming a king or gathering an army."
2264,Female,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,I think that character is the cutest. I like the concept as it seems more silly and fun.
2265,Female,$0-30k,Black,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,first choice fits the words for me and the rest were just random choices
2266,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,45-54,,,The description and background of the image are really interesting to behold.
2267,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,35-44,,,The mouse interacts with the world around him and uses nature as well as his fellow animals to help him achieve his goals.
2268,Male,$61-100k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,I liked choice A since the character reminds me of Robin Hood and looks the most appealing and adventurous. Choice D looks mean and not someone who would aspire to be better.
2269,Male,$31-60k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,,,"The mouse with the red flag in my top choice looks bold and brave, which is appealing. The mouse wiht the wrench in my second choice looks wise. Overall it's a nice set of designs for sure!"
2270,Male,$61-100k,Black,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,I love option C the best because I love how the little mouse is riding the bird and carrying the flag.
2271,Female,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,45-54,,,"A looks like the only unassuming would be leader that others could rally around, the others look like important supporting characters"
2272,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,It looks like an adventurous game. It'll be like a Lord of the rings kinda deal I guess like they all have magical powers and look crazy and do crazy things
2273,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,,,I like all of these on this adventure but the forst two are my favorite a bit. The first one just looks more fun with two characters ters. 2 is mischievous and I like it. Also brings a sense of adventure with thgold
2274,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,,,"I like all of them, but I like F the most because it shows more elements of the fantasy world than just the mice."
2275,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,I chose option C because I like the thought of the mice working together with other unrelated animals (like the bird in this picture) to rule the world.
2276,Male,$61-100k,Other,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,I most prefer option C. This character seems most heroic and i like the fact that they also have a little bird that they ride on as well. Just seems very interesting to me.
2277,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,The character in Option H looks mostly appropriate and great for this because it depicts a very adventurous and curious character.
2278,Female,$0-30k,White,High School,35-44,,,"Option H was the most intriguing and had a whimsical quality that was very endearing. Option A was very creative and I liked the insect addition to the character design. Option C was fun and exciting. Option F had great colors and made me curious about what the mouse was seeing. Option B was cute, but not as adorable as some other options. Option G was a bit too clunky in design. Option E was acceptable, but not as fun and whimsical as earlier choices. Option D was too aggressive in tone."
2279,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,"I would choose option E between the available choices. The concept sounds like a mixture of cute, and something that entails leadership. I feel Option E captures both of that, the character possesses leadership like qualities, while looking appealing, and fitting the tone."
2280,Female,$31-60k,White,High School,25-34,,,I like the rats that are kind of cute. I don't want them to be too creepy.
2281,Female,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,I prefer option C because that image makes me see the game world because of the mouse riding a bird that is harnessed like a horse.  Love that detail. I think the mouse/rat will guide the player through the game world.
2282,Male,$0-30k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,Options G and F a rag tag dress makes it look more relatable to average person.
2283,Female,$31-60k,White,Graduate Degree,25-34,,,Feels like the most adventurous and mysterious.
2284,Female,$31-60k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,"King is more powerful in the world,I think rats and mice are worth for it"
2285,Male,$0-30k,White,Graduate Degree,25-34,,,I think in this type of games I like the strongest characters. Option H reminds the powerful wizard Gandalf. Both A and C are really nice lords. G is the worst since who cares a mechanic or a simple soldier in the game.
2286,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,Options A and G are my favorite characters for this fantasy world game because they have the attitude and costumes that would make the look like powerful characters in this fantasy world which would be a great setting for a fun and interesting game.
2287,Male,$0-30k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,"I picked A first because it has the most awe and wonder. I also like H after that because it inspires the same feeling. F is good because it looks like something is happening in the world. E is good because it makes me think of an adventure, too. D looks like it has an interesting story. B looks like an interesting character. I picked C and G last because they look the least interesting."
2288,Male,$61-100k,Hispanic,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,The animal looks poised and powerful as the stand overlooking the scene. They seem like they are ready for anything that is thrown at them.
2289,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,The eye patch makes this character looks tough and intimidating.
2290,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,I like option H because it sounds the most adventurous and fun to play. I really like the idea of building a following and becoming a king.
2291,Female,$31-60k,Other,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,,,"I like that they look more like humans than mice also, they would probably be the good guys or hero's"
2292,Female,$31-60k,Other,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,,,I like the ones that have a more animated feel to it and less cartoony. Also making them look more human like gives them more character in my opinion.
2293,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,35-44,,,"I THINK THE T REX IN D IS THE BEST DESIGNED AND HAS THE BEST OUTFIT, I WOULD GO WITH D"
2294,Male,$61-100k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,I like the design in a more cool way.
2295,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,I like option B because the dino looks badass and actually the most realistic of the bunch. I think that makes it more fun.
2296,Male,$31-60k,White,Associate Degree,25-34,,,D dinosaur is looking awesome is that outfit. He looks like a boss. I would definitely go with that one.
2297,Female,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,I think it__ cute and funny. I like the pose and the flower.
2298,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,"I prefer the more 2d graphical design, so I would choose option E the most and then I would rate the rest of them based on how close they are to that same 2d design."
2299,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,"I prefer the 3D style, and D is particularly funny to me"
2300,Female,$0-30k,Asian,Graduate Degree,25-34,,,"E was too hard to see since it was so grainy and pixelated. I thought A and C had more whimsical facial expressions and thought the options that were clearly overly digitized (D, F) didn__ seem as expressive."
2301,Female,$0-30k,Black,Associate Degree,25-34,,,"I really liked c, d, a, and b"
2302,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,looks the most appealing and offering the bet detail and what i would expect to find in a video game
2303,Male,$31-60k,Hispanic,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,The first one has the most appeal and swag to him. I think it is pretty cool to see. I also like the art style. It is different than the rest.
2304,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,,,"I like the style of the dressed up dinosaurs more than the other two.  Of the dressed up ones I like the colors on A and C best, then between D and B I like the style of B more, but dont like the cigarette thus I ranked him below D.  That left E and F, I like the styles of these less than the other 4, but liked F more then E"
2305,Male,$61-100k,Asian,Graduate Degree,25-34,,,I find the pixel/cartoon-style dinosaur designs to be the most appealing. The ones that are in 3D or 2.5D style look a bit jarring and uncanny.
2306,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,I like option F the best because I think that it is the most interesting and visually appealing NFT art style out of the six options.
2307,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,21-24,,,"I rated these in order in terms of how much of a badass the character was. Of course, the characaters smoking cigarettes are the most. And the least are the dinos with flowers and whatnot"
2308,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,,,Option F looks really good. It__ unique I like the way the lines look and how it shaded and the colors look really good
2309,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,,,"1, 2, and 3 all have a nice realistic, or at least as much as we know, look to them. i like the velocraptor a lot as well, but 5 has a very long face, which is fine, and 6 is okay, but a bit more cartoony looking than the others. my favs are, by quite a bit, 1 and 2 though due to the realism."
2310,Male,$0-30k,White,Graduate Degree,25-34,,,I like this option because of the classiness of the dinosaur's suit and cigarette.
2311,Male,$61-100k,Hispanic,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,I feel like this is very detailed looking and brings some realism to it. I love that the character is also smoking a cigarette.
2312,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,35-44,,,"E and F are fantastic, they are unique and interesting. E oozes charisma and is perfect. the rest feel kind of plain to me and just flat , they are not bad at all but do not have the same feeling of having a vivid personality like the other two"
2313,Female,$61-100k,Hispanic,Graduate Degree,35-44,,,"B I think has a very humorous element to it, that I also find to be regal and informative too."
2314,Male,$61-100k,White,High School,35-44,,,"Some great options, hard to choose. I'll go with this as my number 1 option."
2315,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,"This one looks tough.  I think the main sell is the jacket.  Due to this look, this is my top pick"
2316,Male,$0-30k,White,High School,25-34,,,I really enjoy digitalized and pixelated art work with attention to detail so for an NFT based game I think that F and E would be appealing to me
2317,Male,$101k+,White,Graduate Degree,65+,,,"I think D looks the most likable, and I like the expression on his face."
2318,Male,$0-30k,Other,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,Option B is the best because the dinosaur and the illustration is well designed.
2319,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,,,"This design looks mean and powerful, I like the look of the dinosaur. Options A, D and C look great, but are a bit romanticized for my taste, I love the design, it's just that they evoke a romantic image that I don't associate with dinosaurs. Options F and E look nice, but the style looks better in the other options."
2320,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,45-54,,,"Looks colorful, authentic and sellable at a good rate."
2321,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,"Option F was my clear favorite, a warfare esque painting without the smoking or flowers. The flowers in my opinion were silly and the smoking is inappropriate for gaming or health in general. I did like the style of F best."
2322,Female,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,,,I like the more realistic looking pictures. I am not much for the cigarettes though as I personally find them repulsive.
2323,Male,$0-30k,White,Associate Degree,25-34,,,"I would personally say that the two appear drawn are superior to the rest, at least as per my tastes. I'm not super fond of the kind of CGI that the others are made with, it reminds me too much of old Disney/Pixar movies from a few years ago. Which works for what they do, this not so much. Choice E is probably my favorite speaking of art and how it looks."
2324,Female,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,55-64,,,The ones holding flowers seem more benign.  I don't care for the ones showing their teeth and smoking.
2325,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,The pixel art looks really unique and colorful It grabbed my attention immediately
2326,Female,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,55-64,,,The realistic ones are more desirable than the cartoon type pictures.
2327,Female,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,,,"Option F looks very sophisticated and suave. Option C also looks well-designed and attractive. Both options are immersive--the more you look the more you see . Option D is almost as good, but not quite. Options A, E and B all look disconcerting and unattractive compared to my top three choices."
2328,Male,$0-30k,Hispanic,Associate Degree,21-24,,,"I love the style of my first choice, and I think it would make the coolest NFT out of all the choices. I like my second choice too, but the style just isn't there. I'm not that into the rest of the options."
2329,Female,$0-30k,White,High School,65+,,,"Option F seems like a classic T-Rex; scary and war-like. Option C isn't war-like, but unusual with her daisy and gold chair, plus her orange color was different from what I expect in dinos. Option E is particularly vicious looking so I think he would appeal to many dinosaur fans with his sharp claws and terrible teeth. Option D doesn't have as much to distinguish him compared to the others. He's sniffing a rose, which is out of character, but not really fierce looking. Option B as a button down, suit wearing dinosaur is strange and might appeal to older people, but he's not fierce. Option A is just unattractive to me, too many colors and not well-defined."
2330,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,45-54,,,"The style in B looks gangsta and the coolest. The style in A gives the impression of a bad guy with a soft spot, same as the style in option C."
2331,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,I think E is the best because a cigar shows more class than a cigarette. I just wish it wasnt as pixelated. I do not like the designs with flowers as the accessory.
2332,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,"I liked B, the well dressed dinosaur makes me think of wall street and money in general"
2333,Male,$61-100k,Asian,Graduate Degree,25-34,,,I ranked the designs of the dinosaur characters that I liked the most.  I found the dinosaur character of option D to be the most appealing followed by option C then option B.  I then liked option A's dinosaur followed by option F and then finally option E.
2334,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,"I like B the best it pops and really stands out. D, A, and C are not bad. F and E look to cheap and old-school."
2335,Male,$0-30k,White,High School,45-54,,,I like the look of option B. It looks a little less like a cartoon.
2336,Female,$31-60k,White,High School,35-44,,,I prefer options D or A because they look the most pretty.
2337,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,"""E"" and ""B"" are the most gangster/sinister so I like them the most.  I don't like any of them with the flower."
2338,Male,$31-60k,Black,High School,25-34,,,Option E style looks cool.  The cigar in the dinosaur mouth adds a lot of swag to the NFT.
2339,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,,,"D, B have great graphics and nice clean imagery that revels skin textures, etc.  A and C are also nice but not as clear and a little blurry. E and F are more comic book-like and not appealing as an NFT image."
2340,Female,$31-60k,White,Associate Degree,25-34,,,"I like how real and handsome the dinosaur in option D is, and I love the fact that he is holding and smelling a rose, its super cute, super attention catching in the best way, and just very nice."
2341,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,"Option E is my favorite because of the pixelated design, which really appeals to me and makes it stand out. Option B is last because it's the least colorful."
2342,Female,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,I like the more __ealistic_ art style much more.
2343,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,The image in Option B looks mostly engaging and realistic which makes it very catchy and appealing to me.
2344,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,"I like the options where they are wearing a suit, this is a unique contrast."
2345,Male,$31-60k,White,Graduate Degree,25-34,,,I like option e the best because I like the retro style of the artwork. Compared to the style of all the other options.
2346,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,25-34,,,I love option F the most because this character looks the most interesting and the most exciting to play with.
2347,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,This looks like a cool game - I like the art that is smoother and has a higher bit rate more - like the images shown in A/C/B/D.  I did not like the more compressed images with obvious bit distortions as shown in F/E.
2348,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,"Options B, D, and C are my favorite.  I like this art style which is more ""realistic"" and has more details in the art.  I prefer that way more than the other options which are more artsy and have less details."
2349,Male,$101k+,Hispanic,Graduate Degree,25-34,,,"I liked the first few that made the dinosaurs look kind of like mafia members, it Makes them sort of mysterious and dangerous. The others are sort of softer so I didn__ like them as much especially the ones with flowers"
2350,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,I love the pixelated retro style of E and I also love the character with the cigarette. Very raw and grimy feeling.  Overall the art style looks really unique.  This looks like a really awesome idea and I would love to check it out.
2351,Female,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,25-34,,,I prefer options f and e because the different art style feels like it allows the Dino__ to have more character.
2352,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,Option E looks too jagged/pixelated when compared to the others.  But I like the designs of the dinos sniffing the flowers.  Unique and classy.  The stegosaurus is potentially appropriate for women as well.
2353,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,It's just best to have them be empty handed. Holding a rose is sonweord for a dinosaur but also having them smoke a cigarette is so disgusting
2354,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,"i like this order, they have to be a good quality but really NFT still??"
2355,Male,$31-60k,Hispanic,High School,65+,,,It is a very personal choice. I have based my work on more artistic and quality drawings than on the
2356,Female,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,,,"F and E have low quality graphics and design. C, D A and B are intriguing, unique, memorable and high quality."
2357,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,,,"I voted for option E, I think the retro design has grown on me since the last time I saw these.  It looks good."
2358,Male,$31-60k,White,Graduate Degree,55-64,,,I like the realism of my top two. I find them interesting. I also like my third and fourth ones because of the old fashion art style of drawing my hand.
2359,Female,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,"I voted merely based on the ""that's cool"" factor. In other words, which ones made me go, ""Oh, I want that"" first."
2360,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,"1. F. Looks most menacing and like a viable video game or cartoon character.2. E. Still has a good villain look, scars make character look cooler.3. B. Honestly don't like the dinosaur in a suit look (reminds me of the BoredApe fad), but at least the realistic reptile skin makes this the best one.4. A. Pretty similar to B, except color scheme is different and less realistic facial details.5. D. The whole dinosaur sniffing a rose graphic is weird and nonsensical.6. C. Don't like the dinosaur sniffing a flower theme, like triceratops a lot less than a T Rex"
2361,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,I ranked them in the order of quality and realism
2362,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,,,I like the livelier colors and details best
2363,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,,,"Can I pick them all?  I don't even know where to start here.  As the prime customer for this, my natural instinct is to pick all 6.  Sure, that's not very helpful.  I get that.   I think the art style, on B, is my favorite.  I can't point to one, and say it's bad.  As far as being interested in something like this?  You bet I am."
2364,Female,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,I like the T-Rex design on this one with the rose. It's so cool and funny looking. The tri-ceratops is cute too.
2365,Female,$31-60k,White,Associate Degree,35-44,,,"I love the rose and how clear it is, looks  lovely! I like the idea of NFTS"
2366,Female,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,55-64,,,"DBC and A are all similar, and i prefer them over E or F...more realistic, yet fun!"
2367,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,,,I don't like the Dino NFT art that includes the flowers. I don't think Dinosaurs and flowers go together. I don't mind the cigarettes and thought that Option F looked really cool.
2368,Female,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,I like this one because it looks female BUT I hate the flower. She needs to look more fierce.
2369,Male,$31-60k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,"I like the grittier feel of option F, reminds me of old wartime games, would be really cool for a P2E mechanic.  After that choice E is cool, I like the pixel art style.  Option A with the mafia styled look is also intriguing although substantially weaker than the first two.  Finally the flower designs seem weird to me, why are they holding flowers?  The flowers doesn't seem to match the theme that well."
2370,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,I think that the image and design of the photo of choice B is the best looking of the 6 choices and the one I would most want to have hanging in my room
2371,Male,$0-30k,White,Associate Degree,25-34,,,"I think option F is by far the best C A D are very nice as well, although not as great, could have a little more detail. Not a big fan of the smoking with the last two."
2372,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,"I like D and C the most because they look fun, and not too serious."
2373,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,These all seem a bit silly to me. D looked the most well done and appealing to me so that is why I chose it.
2374,Female,$31-60k,White,High School,25-34,,,"I like E best by far, it has the most personality and the most unique art style. I think the pixel art style looks cool"
2375,Male,$0-30k,Hispanic,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,"I like the pixel art style. I feel that it is not done enough, and is able to draw my interest to it."
2376,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,,,the color shapes and outfit dresses of each dinosaurs were considered during rating.
2377,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,The flower with the suit in image A id a great looking combo
2378,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,I really like the look of the throwback pixel art. Has a nostalgic feel to it. Don't like the look of the rubbery cgi type art.
2379,Male,$101k+,Asian,Graduate Degree,35-44,,,Choice C seems ironic and funny and fits in with the NFT community.
2380,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,those were the dinosaurs i thought looked cool from best to worst
2381,Male,$61-100k,White,High School,35-44,,,I like the colors and artistic style. Peaks my interest.
2382,Female,$0-30k,Black,Bachelor's Degree,21-24,,,The ones with the suits just look funnier
2383,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,35-44,,,"I don't like the look of the images with the flowers, it takes away any menacing look about them. I do like the art style of option F. I think everything about it looks good."
2384,Male,$61-100k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,21-24,,,"I prefer choice A over the others, although choice C, B and D come very close to second place. I prefer the clean-cut designs of these options over the retro/8-bit design of option E and F. I definitely prefer choice A over the others, it looks classy and the art style is very appealing and eye-catching. Good luck with your app."
2385,Male,$31-60k,Asian,Graduate Degree,25-34,,,MOST REALISTIC AND LOVELY / MUCH REALISTIC  / BETTER STYLE GIVEN / GOOD SWAG / VERY LOW QUALITY PICTURE / POOR STYLE AND QUALITY
2386,Female,$31-60k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,,,The images with the flower don't look appealing to me. I like the look of choice F. It has a unique art style compared to the others.
2387,Male,$61-100k,Black,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,I like option B the best because I like how the dinosaur is wearing a suit and he has a stoic look on his face.   The style makes him look like a hard nosed dinosaur.
2388,Female,$61-100k,Asian,Associate Degree,45-54,,,B & D look very dimensional and worth collecting. The rest are not as exciting or artistic looking.
2389,Male,$101k+,White,Graduate Degree,45-54,,,I put in order by they look to me only - C is best then F D A B and E - I do not like the smoking in B and E to be honest.
2390,Female,$0-30k,White,High School,35-44,,,OPTION B it is so detailed and down to the talons/claws it looks wife like it is so detailed and definitely stands out in appeals to me more than the other ones and then I chose option D for the same reason
2391,Female,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,I think some of them are very well done and look very Mob like
2392,Male,$0-30k,Hispanic,Associate Degree,21-24,Simulation; Strategy; Arcade; Adventure; Action,,I like this one because the characters look more rough around the edges and more fitting in an apocalyptic setting.
2393,Male,$0-30k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Board; Card,,I prefer A because it looks authentic. I find it stands out more.
2394,Male,$0-30k,Hispanic,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Sports; Adventure; Action,,"A is a lot more stylized, and makes each of the characters stand out and more unique."
2395,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Simulation; Role Playing; Puzzle; Casino; Adventure,,"In an apocalypse, it seems unrealistic that everyone will be in their normal work clothes. Option A is much more realistic in that weapons would also be on hand for defense."
2396,Male,$0-30k,White,High School,45-54,Strategy; Card; Arcade; Adventure,,Looks less cartoonish and more like a unique style and character set
2397,Male,$0-30k,White,High School,25-34,Arcade; Card; Educational; Strategy; Puzzle,,I prefer the more weird cartoon character style that is used here in A it makes sense to me
2398,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,21-24,Action; Adventure; Sports; Trivia; Simulation,,Both are good but the characters are a little more intense
2399,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,Arcade; Adventure; Action,,Choice A seems like a stronger art style judging by the aesthetics
2400,Male,$101k+,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Sports; Board; Puzzle,,I prefer option A because the characters have a more violent vibe to them that fits better with a zombie survival game.
2401,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Puzzle; Educational; Card; Trivia; Word,,I prefer B because I think the characters look more unique. They don't remind me of other games.
2402,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,25-34,Action; Casino; Arcade; Trivia,,"I like the art style in option B because the outfits are more colorful and eye catching. I really like the construction worker in option B, I relate with him a lot."
2403,Male,$31-60k,Black,Associate Degree,25-34,Music; Family; Casino; Board,,The style looks more stylish and real
2404,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Simulation,,"Option A seems to be a better fit for a post apocalyptic game and they look cooler, more edgy. The options in B seem pretty regular, just with different stuff (doctor with golf clubs, etc.). I like the black woman in white with the dog!"
2405,Male,$61-100k,Hispanic,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Strategy; Sports; Action; Role Playing; Racing,,These characters look like they are more ready to go into Battle in this kind of game.
2406,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,45-54,Puzzle; Casino; Role Playing; Simulation,,"The set in B looks more like everyday people in the world who were forced to change their lives to become fighters, but would still retain their personalities and ""old life"" skills. I think it gives them more personality and imagination when you look at them than just regular looking random post-apocalyptic characters which is what A makes me think of."
2407,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,25-34,Puzzle; Adventure; Arcade; Action; Role Playing,,The larger dynamic characters just have a better appearance. It looks more fun. The larger guy looks so fun to play. The chainsaw guy would be awesome too.
2408,Male,$31-60k,Asian,Graduate Degree,25-34,Trivia; Strategy; Simulation; Role Playing; Action,,I prefer A over B because the characters in A are more unique and attractive than B
2409,Male,$61-100k,White,High School,21-24,Puzzle; Trivia; Strategy; Simulation,,B feels less extreme of a shift from normal life.
2410,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Sports; Adventure; Strategy; Role Playing,,"#5 in B attracts me most to the art style. I think the simplicity of the shading and the way weapons are highlighted in this style looks a lot better than a lot of the extreme styles like steampunk in A. I just find the roster in A to be a bit ridiculous in aggregate compared to B. 5 is my favorite because she looks powerful, fast, and fun to play."
2411,Male,$31-60k,Asian,Graduate Degree,25-34,Simulation; Racing; Puzzle; Adventure; Action,,these characters are more attractive
2412,Male,$0-30k,White,High School,35-44,Adventure; Casino; Puzzle; Role Playing; Word,,"These ones look quite memorable and original and I generally like this type of animated style, though this has some originality of its own"
2413,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Racing; Role Playing; Sports; Trivia,,the characters on a look more aggressive
2414,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Board; Card; Role Playing; Strategy; Adventure,,The characters are darker and seem to have dealt with their fair share of zombies.  Option B seems more kid friendly.  Spunky and fun but not as edgy.  I feel A would have a better appeal to the masses due to its relatable characters.
2415,Male,$0-30k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Action; Adventure; Role Playing; Simulation; Card,,"Although both options have interesting concepts, I chose Option A mostly because it has more diversity."
2416,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Word,,"I think the simpler, more realistic characters of B click a little more. I love the doctor with the golf clubs, her image tells her story of what happened and how she got there."
2417,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Trivia; Action; Adventure; Puzzle; Sports,,These characters seem gritty and __ard_. I like that when it comes to zombies
2418,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Puzzle; Strategy; Sports; Casino; Card,,Option A because the characters look like they are more detailed.  #3 was the most attractive because he looked like a real person
2419,Male,$0-30k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Adventure; Puzzle; Action; Strategy; Board,,"Option B is really stylized with a hint of realism added, where these could be real people. Character 2 in Option B sticks out the most to me because her outfit tells a really interesting story, and her design is really memorable and unique."
2420,Male,$61-100k,White,High School,35-44,Adventure; Board; Puzzle; Strategy; Arcade,,the people in A just look tougher which is who would survive a zombie breakout
2421,Male,$31-60k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Role Playing; Strategy,,I prefer option A because to me the characters look more fun and engaging. Option B looks decent but does not compel me as much overall.
2422,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Adventure; Simulation; Puzzle,,I like this one because it looks more original and the other reminds me of team fortress
2423,Male,$61-100k,Black,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Adventure; Action; Role Playing; Strategy; Simulation,,I like option B the best because I like that the characters are dressed in a more realistic natural style compared to the characters shown in option A.  I also like the art style in option B better than option A as well.  Option A has too many finer details that seem like they are overkill.
2424,Male,$0-30k,Black,High School,21-24,Trivia; Puzzle; Strategy; Arcade; Action,,"Option B's art style is more appealing and the character designs are more inspired, given each character's occupation."
2425,Male,$0-30k,White,Graduate Degree,25-34,Role Playing; Simulation,,Option A is more visually interesting.
2426,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Adventure; Strategy; Simulation; Role Playing,,"The art styles are very similar. I prefer Option B as those characters looks just a bit more real, instead of cartoony.I like Option B, Character 3, the construction worker. Who better to have around during a zombie apocalypse than someone who can build?"
2427,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Word,,"These characters look more normal and like generic people.  The other one seems strange and more ""off"".  I would rather play with characters like myself."
2428,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,35-44,Casino; Action; Puzzle; Card; Word,,They seem more futuristic.  The one with the dog because I would want to have a dog with me too.
2429,Male,$101k+,Hispanic,Graduate Degree,25-34,Music; Family; Educational; Role Playing; Adventure,,"These characters seem to have a wider range of occupations, they seem really interesting! I really like that one of them has a little car and another has a drone."
2430,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Action; Adventure; Strategy; Trivia; Word,,I prefer A. I feel like there is more diversity among the characters in terms of size and style. It makes the group more interesting
2431,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,Sports; Trivia; Music; Puzzle,,I chose option A.  I like the more masculine ones and the third one over with all of the armor.
2432,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Arcade; Strategy; Trivia; Role Playing; Simulation,,The colors are more vibrant and it's more over the top.
2433,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,25-34,Casino,,great variety here and a bit more realistic too
2434,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,45-54,Puzzle; Sports; Arcade; Adventure; Action,,The characters are really cool and amazing.
2435,Male,$61-100k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Role Playing; Educational; Casino; Adventure; Action,,The style and approach on this option makes the characters more unique and have a better dynamic amongst them. Personality is a big thing with video game characters in my opinion any setting. But this post apocalyptic vibe looks really cool more sci-fi and futuristic.
2436,Male,$0-30k,Black,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Role Playing; Strategy,,The art style adds a bit of underlying humanity to the characters despite the over the top designs
2437,Male,$61-100k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,21-24,Card; Strategy; Simulation; Adventure; Action,,Choice A looks much cleaner and well deisgned when compared to choice B. Choice B also looks good but it looks more like an indie-company art style that probably would not hold up well. The design in choice A definitely caught my attention.
2438,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Card; Word; Role Playing; Adventure; Action,,"All of these characters are cool so this was a tough pick, but I like the makeshift weapons and armors shown in B more. Especially the construction worker, that seems very fitting for a survivalist."
2439,Male,$0-30k,White,High School,35-44,Word; Trivia; Racing; Card; Arcade,,choice B has more realistic features with the characters
2440,Male,$0-30k,White,High School,25-34,Trivia; Sports; Role Playing,,The designs in A are better. They look cooler and I would be more interested in playing a game with those characters.
2441,Male,$61-100k,White,Associate Degree,35-44,Puzzle; Trivia,,I like option A because the character with the chainsaw is interesting and looks fierce.
2442,Male,$101k+,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Strategy; Board; Puzzle; Word; Simulation,,I like this art style because it feels like just the right combination of polish and grunge. Character #4 attracts me the most because I really want to see how he uses that drone companion.
2443,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Trivia; Puzzle; Educational; Board; Action,,This one has more of a fantasy feel and is brighter colors and I think I like a little bit better.
2444,Male,$0-30k,Other,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Role Playing; Puzzle,,A has the better art style. Looks better and looks higher quality to me. I like number 1 in choice A the most.
2445,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,Casino; Puzzle,,"I voted for option A, the characters look more like they belong in a post apocalyptic world, I like the character design for the first character, she looks tough."
2446,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Racing; Action,,The characters have flair and playfulness
2447,Male,$61-100k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Strategy; Role Playing,,I liked choice A since the design looks more appealing and eye catching and the characters look more intimidating. I liked the 6th character in choice A since they look the most scary and strongest.
2448,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,35-44,Role Playing; Music; Family; Arcade; Adventure,,these guys look cooler than the others
2449,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Trivia; Card; Casino; Sports,,I like that they're wearing realistic outfits. I think it be fun to player zombie game with characters like this
2450,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Adventure; Board; Card; Casino,,"I like choice A because the Characters look stronger, and the details are sharper.   The character that looks most interesting to me is the Fireman.    He looks to have both lifesaving and lifetaking skills."
2451,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Arcade; Casino; Puzzle; Sports; Word,,The characters in a stand out just a little more. They look more powerful and their weapons are better
2452,Male,$61-100k,Black,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Adventure; Racing; Strategy; Action; Simulation,,"I like Option A's art style more than I do Option B. Option A looks a bit more modernized and fresh. Option B seems a bit old and outdated to me personally. I like the sharpness of Option A, and it looks to be more detailed."
2453,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Role Playing; Strategy,,I prefer the option A art style because I like the more animated facial expressions and artwork shown in this image with the more extreme and dangerous looking character designs with the bigger weapons shown in the option A image. I most like the chainsaw wielding character in the option A image because he looks tough and strong.
2454,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Strategy; Trivia,,Option B is my preferred design because tbecause the colors used are brighter and more vibrant. It makes me think the game will be more light hearted and fun.
2455,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,35-44,Action; Adventure; Role Playing; Simulation; Strategy,,"more unique and interesting, the other option feels too plain and realistic,  A is a little over the top but that is what I want in a game"
2456,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Adventure; Strategy; Role Playing,,"I prefer the slightly more minimal art style of B, plus the characters look more cohesive and interesting.  A feel more random and disjointed."
2457,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Action; Arcade; Word,,The characters here looked more down to earth and normal and adapted to the new way of life by slowing changing.
2458,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,25-34,Action; Board; Arcade; Puzzle; Sports,,I choose the option A because I was thinking it's so interesting and so colorful.
2459,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,25-34,Strategy; Word; Puzzle; Action,,Option A looks like it fits the post-apocalyptic style much  better than B. B just doesn't have the same 'gritty' feel that A does. I really like #3 in choice A. He looks like someone that would hold back a horde of zombies by himself. #2 is also a really cool looking dude.
2460,Male,$0-30k,White,Associate Degree,35-44,Action; Puzzle; Strategy,,I pick the group in B because I like that it blends real life jobs with the over the top style and looks. I feel the characters in A would fit in any type of survival game and doesn__ stand out. Seeing real jobs like doctor and construction that have to survive makes the characters more interesting and could have a better back story to me.
2461,Male,$0-30k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Role Playing; Strategy,,Option A has more of a cyber punk theme to it and more fitting to average person they can compare to.
2462,Male,$101k+,White,High School,35-44,Simulation; Strategy; Puzzle,,"B's characters are a little more colorful and look like they include more varied career paths.  I feel like B is more relatable, while A is more abstract.  I like some of the improvised weapons in B too, and imagine there may be different classes with different strengths,"
2463,Male,$61-100k,Asian,Graduate Degree,35-44,Casino; Simulation; Adventure; Trivia; Sports,,"I like the style in option B as it is different and the characters seem more realistic. This seems great and love the look of each of them here. Overall, good piece and excellent drawings in each."
2464,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Casino; Puzzle; Action; Adventure; Sports,,The characters look more simple and less extravagant than the other option.
2465,Male,$101k+,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Adventure; Puzzle,,I like B because the characters are dressed as regular people whereas A they're dressed as video game characters. B seems more realistic and I can be more in touch with a construction worker fighting monsters and trying to survive.
2466,Male,$61-100k,Asian,Graduate Degree,25-34,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Racing; Sports,,I prefer the character designs of option A more than option B.  I like how bloody they look and fits the style of game more.
2467,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,21-24,Strategy; Simulation; Role Playing; Casino; Adventure,,"B feels more realistic and something I could see myself playing as, while A is too stylized and makes me lose immersion with the game__ theme."
2468,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Adventure; Casino; Music; Sports,,"I prefer Option B because these characters, with their dress and demeanor, are quite compelling and would make for a more engaging post-apocalyptic survival/zombie-themed strategy war game."
2469,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Strategy; Puzzle; Adventure,,I really like ooption B because the female characters look really sexy. I like the one in the blue with the golf clubs as she looks really badass.
2470,Male,$101k+,Asian,Graduate Degree,35-44,Arcade,,I like the real life construction worker and a tourist in the characters.
2471,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Adventure,,I like option A because I prefer how the characters are dressed and I prefer their poses.
2472,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Casino; Puzzle; Trivia,,I like that B looks more close to how people look and dress today. I think A goes too extreme with the outfits and with the hair and style of the characters. I like that B shows more different job titles and incorporates them into the zombie theme well.
2473,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Action; Arcade; Role Playing; Strategy; Puzzle,,"Overall it seems like the characters in the other version are darker colored and a little bit more violet looking with one even having some blood dripping on the ground from a chainsaw.  There is no need for the characters to see dark and imposing, and in fact i would be more interested in a post apocalyptic game that was just a little more light - and these characters seem like that."
2474,Male,$0-30k,White,High School,35-44,Puzzle; Role Playing; Arcade; Trivia; Strategy,,I like both options to be honest depending on what the overall world looks like. But this option that is a little more over the top designed and set in a more fantastical looking world draws me in more.
2475,Male,$101k+,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Word; Strategy; Role Playing; Adventure; Action,,"The styles are pretty similar but I would lean toward B. I like the sharper lines over the cell shading in A. Both character designs seem to have your standard set of default character types (young girl with sword, person with pet, chain saw guy, strong-man, etc) but I like the first two characters in B (girl in yellow jacket and the man in red shirt) over those in A. They look like they would be pretty fun to play. The sword girl and female doctor in B are also interesting."
2476,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,25-34,Word; Strategy; Trivia,,I like the style of B more because they seem like exaggerated versions of realistic people and occupations.  In contrast the characters in A seem a bit over the top.
2477,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Casino; Trivia; Word; Action; Arcade,,"B seems to have a wider array of characters.  The kid wit the drone, the business man. the high school athlete and the girl with her pet.  The characters stretch better."
2478,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Adventure; Action,,"I think the characters of B seem more like they'd be in a post apocalyptic game. I especially like the construction worker, because he seems like he'd be a fun character to interact with."
2479,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Board; Simulation; Strategy; Puzzle; Role Playing,,"The character designs in A appeal more to my sense, I like the exaggerated looks of them"
2480,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Simulation; Sports; Strategy; Adventure; Action,,I liked B because the characters seems more like every day people
2481,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Adventure; Puzzle; Role Playing; Strategy,,I chose option B because I like that the clothing is based on real life people and the outfits are recognizable.  I prefer that over the other option where I think they are more cartoonish based.
2482,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Sports,,Choice A is the art style that I prefer because the look that it has to it is more clean and realistic looking to me compared to Choice B but it still has a artsy and painted over look to it. The character that caught my eye the most is the purple haired woman with the skateboard. She just looks cool to me and I liked her style.
2483,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,Puzzle; Word,,These characters are a little more realistic and a little less cartoonish and would probably be more fun to play
2484,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Puzzle; Sports; Strategy,,I like B because the characters are more realistic looking and seem like they might be just regular people caught in a zombie apocalypse.  #7 is the character that gets my attention because of the weird combination of scientist with a bag of golf clubs as weapons.
2485,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Trivia; Strategy,,I think that the characters in option A appear more versatile and fun to play as.  I can imagine playing as each character and how my style of gameplay would change
2486,Male,$101k+,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Arcade; Action; Adventure,,I chose B because it is a post apocalyptic game. That means that people would be normal every day people forced to survive. B shows that they look like normal people but they have weapons and other things that they have grabbed to help them survive.
2487,Male,$0-30k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Action; Adventure; Role Playing; Strategy; Educational,,I like the art style in option A better as it looks more detailed and appealing. Character #6 in this set attracts my attention the most for his choice of weapon.
2488,Male,$31-60k,White,Graduate Degree,25-34,Simulation; Sports; Strategy; Puzzle; Role Playing,,I feel like option A is more eye catching and there's more of a story behind the characters. I am drawn into them and want to play them and know more. I think the skateboarder makes me most curious because they are the most unique but also look the most powerful which fits my style of play the most.
2489,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,35-44,Adventure; Simulation; Strategy; Trivia; Role Playing,,"THE CHARACTERS IN A SEEM MORE VERSATILE TO ME, I ALSO LIKE THEIR LOOK MORE.   OUT OF THE TWO SETS, I FIND A MORE APPEALING"
2490,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Action; Adventure; Role Playing; Strategy; Simulation,,these look more heroic and badass and exciting. the others look too plain and boring in comparison
2491,Male,$101k+,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Puzzle; Simulation; Strategy; Sports,,"Even though these are characters, I like how Option B are more like real people. Since it's a post-apocolyptic game, I like seeing how the characters transitioned from their pre-apocolyptic professions to the zombie apocolypse. I particularly like the construction worker who continues to wear his flourescent orange. I recognize that this choice of clothing would likely be nonsense because it could draw attention to yourself; however, I found the artwork appealing."
2492,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Sports; Role Playing; Puzzle,,I am most interested in this character and worldview. It looks like the most creative way to view the game mode.
2493,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,35-44,Casino; Adventure; Arcade; Action; Role Playing,,"I love the bug creature with humanoid features in my top pick, reminds me of some sort of intelligent bugs that could be a potential threat.  I'd like to see their culture."
2494,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Action; Arcade; Word,,The ones I liked the most and picked first were the ones that made me think of wonder and adventure and exploring. The type of world I was thinking of was adventure and exploration.
2495,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Sports; Role Playing; Arcade; Adventure; Action,,"Option A is the most appealing overall. The colors blend together well, creating a natural scenery. The characters are conveying enough emotion to draw me in, and make want to experience the world."
2496,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Card; Casino; Arcade; Word; Puzzle,,I really like how this one was so realistic looking. I thought it looked really cool.
2497,Male,$101k+,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Trivia; Word; Sports,,"I'm more interested in gameplay that seems more mystical or fantasy oriented, so ranked the designs that evoked that concept for me a little bit higher than the ones that evoked battling."
2498,Male,$31-60k,White,Associate Degree,25-34,Strategy; Puzzle; Arcade; Adventure; Sports,,H looks like it would be an interesting world. I would imagine playing a game like in the universe of ants life. But battling for total control of the land.
2499,Male,$0-30k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Role Playing; Strategy,,Option E creates a sense of hybrid humans and being able to adapt.
2500,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,Strategy; Simulation; Role Playing,,I love the Alice in Wonderland vibes that this image gives off. I feel like I have been transported right into the book. Seeing this image makes me think this will be an adventure game. I would look forward to elements of an RPG combined with an adventure style of experience.
2501,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,25-34,Word; Strategy; Trivia,,"I liked the desolate, fallen, and challenging themes of the world views in D and G. I didn__ have as much interest in the cartoonish looks of F and A because they didn__ seem to have as much challenge and intrigue."
2502,Male,$61-100k,Hispanic,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Strategy; Sports; Action; Role Playing; Racing,,"For me I want gameplay that involves battling to the death to get what you want. Seeing this image with the weapon in one hand and a skull in the other, lets me know this is the one for me."
2503,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,45-54,Trivia; Sports; Racing; Puzzle; Action,,I would be interested in knowing their ordeals in their various habitats.
2504,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Adventure; Board; Card; Casino,,I chose the ones I think are undergoing a great adventure like treasure hunting or going through wonderland.
2505,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Casino; Adventure; Racing; Sports; Word,,I like option A the best because the image looks the most detailed.
2506,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Strategy; Puzzle; Adventure,,"I like option G because I am fascinated by bees, their lives, and their colonies. I think there is so much to learn and would love seeing how they work. I think the character looks pretty badass too."
2507,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,Music; Strategy; Word,,I picked G because I love the color. That tells me that gameplay will be eventful. And the juxtaposition of the skull shows that there will be twists and turns along the way.
2508,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Arcade; Casino; Puzzle; Sports; Word,,A is the most interesting to me.  It reminds me of Alice and wonderland.  I would expect it to be a first player game play.  I would expect it to follow a similar story to Alice and Wonderland.
2509,Male,$0-30k,Black,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Role Playing; Puzzle; Arcade; Adventure; Action,,"Option H seems like it would make for an excellent action game akin  Ratchet and Clank or the Jak series, but with a slightly more serious tone. The world view would be something like the latest God of War game but you know more beetle focused."
2510,Male,$61-100k,Other,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Strategy; Simulation; Role Playing; Puzzle; Educational,,"All right importantly I need to get some things off my chest, [F] is the best because it's cartoony but looks a bit like dishonored. None of these were PARTICULARLY appealing. My first few picks were for unique reasons though. [A] looks like an epic adventure game based on Alice In Wonderland so I'm all for that after [F]. Next we have [C] because it reminds of overwatch. [D] was almost third but became fourth because I very rarely see this type of art associated with enjoyable games; the games have good concepts but are poorly executed. [H] reminds of Destiny in art style and presentation, so no high hopes there. [B] looks like a side scroller with 3D elements, has potential but worse than the others. The last two are terrible. [G] is a bee that wants to be in Warhammer, and [E] is a mobile game for little boys. So there's my choices."
2511,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Strategy; Role Playing; Simulation; Action; Adventure,,"The background makes it look more magical.  Secondly, the character has a decent amount of detail and is accessorized to where it catches my interest"
2512,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Arcade; Role Playing; Simulation; Strategy,,"""A"" is the one I'm most interested in.  It would be amazing to explore the world of Wonderland as Alice.  The possibilities seem endless."
2513,Male,$0-30k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Board; Card,,I like choice A is visually appealing. I'm looking forward to a role-playing gameplay.
2514,Male,$61-100k,White,High School,45-54,Word; Puzzle; Arcade; Adventure; Action,,"I picked the first few because I'm a fan of ""cartoony"" type games, where true to life graphics aren't that important or appealing to me.  I'm also not really into games with gore etc, so the last two aren't jiving with me. I appreciate the artwork & graphics, but definitely they aren't my preferred games.  For gameplay experience, again, I'm not looking for real world physics etc.  Just give me a game with nice, colorful graphics with saturated colors and fun gameplay & mechanics, and I'm a happy guy.  In other worlds, I'm more of a Mario guy than COD or Halo etc."
2515,Male,$0-30k,White,High School,25-34,Action; Role Playing; Sports; Strategy; Racing,,"Option H is the most interesting to me, I really like the art style. I think this world view would be great because we would have the world view of a bug and get to travel into their interesting and unique world."
2516,Male,$31-60k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Strategy; Action; Adventure; Arcade; Role Playing,,The beetles in my top choices are striking and confident. The bee is also energetic and appealing for sure!
2517,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,Sports; Strategy; Racing,,Option A looks interesting and the graphics are detailed. This makes me think the game might be something along the lines of Alice in Wonderland. Maybe an MMO of sorts. I think the game will be played from the perspective of the girl shown.
2518,Male,$0-30k,White,High School,35-44,Word; Trivia; Racing; Card; Arcade,,"choices e,a,h,g have more realistic images"
2519,Male,$61-100k,Black,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Adventure; Action; Role Playing; Strategy; Simulation,,I like option B the best because I like the worldview play of looking at the view of the ants working together as they go about the tasks that need to be done.
2520,Male,$101k+,White,High School,25-34,Puzzle; Casino; Card; Arcade; Action,,I'm most interested in A because it shows multiple characters and has me questioning what it's about. The other art is fine but doesn't tell you anything about it. I really don't know what worldview or gameplay would be present with so little information in the images besides maybe a insect fighting game but I'm intrigued to know more.
2521,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Trivia; Card; Casino; Sports,,The character looks cool. I think it looks original I like the fact that it's kinda human bug looking. I would hope it would be some kind of first person shooter game but with bugs
2522,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Simulation; Action; Puzzle; Racing; Strategy,,"The top ranked choices look the best designed, most new interesting, intriguing and unique."
2523,Male,$31-60k,Black,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Sports; Racing; Music; Casino,,I like the images where the insects assume a position of power and dominance as this game looks like it is a kingdom war between colonys
2524,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Strategy; Trivia; Word; Role Playing; Puzzle,,Option E looks fascinating. I love the Idea of a bug like soldier in a world like this. The art is very unique. H is similar and very intriguing as well.
2525,Male,$0-30k,White,High School,25-34,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Music; Puzzle,,"I picked A, E, F and B as my top choices as the design and pictures feel like they are a fun concept to play a game on. I picked C, G, D and H as my least choices as the pictures look too scary for me to play a game on."
2526,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Role Playing; Simulation; Strategy; Sports; Action,,"I think A is the most interesting. It captures the eye, a little funny and has something familiar about. I like the design of H the most, but I do not like bug and it is perhaps too photorealistic."
2527,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,Family; Puzzle; Action; Role Playing; Strategy,,"B makes absolutely no sense to me. For C I liked Insecticons but ever since I have had an aversion to mechanical bug concepts. F seems like a cheap ripoff of a dreamworks straight to netflix series. D looks kind of cool but it is hard for me to make sense of it. G has a neat look even though I don't love the yellow look. I think A would have the makings of a good storyline. Option E has a nice image and it a very close second. I really like the unique look of H and I feel like it has serious possibilities, it really stands out."
2528,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Casino; Puzzle; Trivia,,I like B because it seems there is some construction element to the game. I like both E and H because they show weapons and I like that E has a human in a bug outfit. A reminds me of Alice in wonderland and seems fun. I don__ care for the bug in clothing. The other bugs in G C and D all look interesting and I like the bee the best with the skull because it looks the most menacing.
2529,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Adventure; Casino; Music; Sports,,I prefer Option E and H for this worldview gameplay because these particular characters are tough and strong and very engaging and would make for a very compelling gameplay scenario.
2530,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,45-54,Puzzle; Music; Action,,"I ranked them according to the action I might expect when playing the game.  I really like the concept of attacking insects and a game that is exciting and really thrills me.  That's why I ranked them in that order...whichever one would offer the worldview experience of one-on-one battle with the insect.  The more aggressive looking, the better.  I'm envisioning a world where there is some strategy involved and landscapes to explore...but where I have to fight the insects to move forward!"
2531,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Strategy; Word,,"E h and g really make it seem like there is a very bold and brave main character, that makes me feel happy and interested.in their leadership capabilities"
2532,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Racing; Sports; Role Playing; Adventure; Action,,"I liked the reality of the option H, E and G. I think that reality makes it more fun to play."
2533,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,Card; Board; Racing; Puzzle; Adventure,,"i like to play well animated games , in order I prefer to option G . It was attracts me to play it . the theme was so good in looking . It has the power of eye catching ."
2534,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Board; Adventure; Role Playing; Puzzle; Card,,I like A because it paints the picture of a whole world not just a character in it so I am drawn to it.
2535,Male,$101k+,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Puzzle; Board; Card; Strategy; Trivia,,"I ranked my choices based on which images looked the most adventurous, as that's the type of gameplay experience I prefer."
2536,Male,$0-30k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Arcade; Role Playing; Simulation; Sports; Puzzle,,A because I loved  Alice in Wonderland as a child and I would be excited to play a videogame where you could explore Alice's world.
2537,Male,$31-60k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Role Playing; Strategy,,"I prefer option C because it seems the most daring and challenging. Option E, A, G, and D feel quite exciting and fun to me too. Option B, H, and F feel too easy for my tastes."
2538,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Adventure; Puzzle; Card; Action; Strategy,,"E, D, H, and G  all remind me of hollow knight a game that was about exploring the ruins of an ancient bug civilization.  This was one of my favorite games to come out in the last few years, and I'd love to play a game that had a similar world or even just a similar experience of exploring, powering up, and unlocking new areas with my abilities.  B, A, and F, look like some kind of incredibly boring Alice in Wonderland knock off.  I don't think I'd like to play such a game with characters looking like that, unless they really nailed the gameplay.  Even then I'd prefer it to not look so silly."
2539,Male,$31-60k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Action; Adventure; Role Playing; Simulation; Strategy,,Just looks the most interesting and has the most intriguing backstory that I could think of.
2540,Male,$31-60k,White,Graduate Degree,45-54,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Trivia; Educational,,A worldview from a vantage point of ugly insects? Most of these images are upright nasty. The only one that's of any possible interest to me is Option A because there's something of an Alice in Wonderland feel to it.
2541,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,Action; Racing; Role Playing; Simulation,,"Definitely appreciate the Alice in Wonderland vibe.  I like the art style too.   Alice in Wonderland is one of those themes that you can't really overdo.  It's so crazy, as is, that you  can just put your own spin on it, and still be able to create something great."
2542,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,I like that he looks normal. It hides all the dangerous aspects of his abilities.
2543,Male,$61-100k,White,Vocational Training,25-34,,,"I like Options F & D best. With the description talking about how he loves the west, these characters work the best. They a dressed in suits and not robes, which help the Gotti comparison"
2544,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,45-54,,,"A attracts me more, the sublime design structure and the element of action pack used is something that i adore. its a cool theme."
2545,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,"Option A fits well as a yakuza boss, his look is intimidating and his presence or aura is powerful. The image presented gave justice to the character."
2546,Male,$0-30k,White,Graduate Degree,25-34,,,"option D has nothing to do with the Yakuzas, he looks like normal gang member. the weapon choice is also terrible in D. I can say the same thing for F and E also, they look like normal characters, not Yakuza nor boss. Option C and A are the best, they are perfect for a boss, and then for a Yakuza"
2547,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,,,"i think that 1, 2 and 3 show this type best. 4-6 all appear to be traditional japanese clothing, but from the description it sounds more likely that he prefer to look american, modeling himself after Dapper. 1-3 have that type of look. the reds seem to look more expensive too, and more designer like. the others are all nice, but as much as i like the traditional japanese garb, it doesn't seem to fit the description. i also like the sunglasses type look."
2548,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,"In Options B and C, the design is too traditional, as the character description portrays someone who doesn't want to be associated so much with old school, hierarchal Japanese society. In Option F, he's the best blend of being flamboyant yet powerful in appearance."
2549,Male,$61-100k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,I liked choice B since the character fits the description and holding the katana looks more intimidating. Choice F looks more relaxed and not as intimidating or scary.
2550,Male,$31-60k,Black,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,"Options F,A,C and B are best looking styles that fit the yakuza look and way they dress the best. I love the style and gentleman like clothing style that these options have. Options E and D are a bit wild, but these not looks aren't horrible."
2551,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,45-54,,,I think the style in option F is the best because the man is portrayed as a dangerous being and also a man loves a luxurious lifestyle. The style in D also comes close.
2552,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,,,"So this Japanese gang boss loves designer clothing, then Choice F, A, and E represents the best design clothing that he would do."
2553,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,"I think option B fits the best for four reasons. His style reflects the story the best. The fashion choice and the weapon chosen reflect the theme the best. The color scheme for the fashion choices mostly the black color scheme reflects the symbolism of working from the shadows with his enterprise. And finally the quality of the clothing, specifically the silk robe, indicates the description of him displaying his wealth. So I think option B is the best option and I like it the most. I like option A second best for similar reasons. Two reasons it's my second favorite and not my first are the color scheme is primarily blue instead of black and the weapon is sheathed which seems to reflect less the concept of the character leading in front instead of delegating the work so much. But Option A is a close second, aside from a few differences it's an excellent overall presentation and I like the elements of the fashion choices for color scheme, perspective, contrast and the materials chosen for the clothing. I like option F third best because it's one of the most fashionable designs for the clothing choices. The scarf, the very nice suit and pants and shoes are all symbolic of a high level of wealth. What's missing for why it's not one of my top two choices is some kind of weapon that reflects his role as a leader of criminals, option B and A effectively communicate that aspect better. Otherwise option F is excellent for color scheme, for the overall look, and for the choices of material for the clothing. I like option C fourth best for two main reasons. The suit jacket looks a little shabby and there's no weapon. So it's not my favorite of the choices because the other choices, specifically F, A, and B present an image more consistent with the story and underlying theme. Option E is my fifth favorite because the choice of weapon is odd. A sword I can understand. The cane looks a little out of place and doesn't quite match the description of the character being flamboyant and having designer clothes and very expensive presentation. The design of the clothing is a little unusual and it doesn't look as nice or as expensive as some of the other options and so with respect to the cane and the fashion choices it's not as effective at the options I rated higher at conveying the flamboyance and the wealth. I like option D the least because it seems the most non reflective of the description of the character. The shirt looks cheap and silly, the choice of weapon isn't as effective at communicating the theme that the sword does, and the clothing doesn't match as well. The fashion choices just don't convey vast wealth but rather someone trying to look like they're on vacation or something and that's just not as effective a presentation in my opinion compared to the other options. I don't think option D fits the story best. I don't prefer the style because it doesn't really convey the idea that he's a leader of an organization. The elements of option A and B are more effective at conveying strength and leadership than option D, so that's why I ranked B and A so high on the list and option D as my least favorite option."
2554,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,The man in B holding the sword reminds me of a samuri warrior.  I find it engaging and attractive.
2555,Male,$0-30k,White,Associate Degree,45-54,,,"C, A and B seem more stylized.  E, F and D seem too modern."
2556,Male,$0-30k,White,High School,25-34,,,I chose option F and D because of the brighter in your face color scheme that seems to go with his backstory.
2557,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,I like option F because his looks and story match very well. It is very realistic and authentic which will make this game fun.
2558,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,"I always love a good mob boss story while playing a game, and I think this character will fit perfectly with the game based on the description."
2559,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,"For a gang style mobile game, Options A and D, in that order, are my preferred choices because of the way they are dressed and their weapons and most of all their demeanor and attitude and bearing."
2560,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,25-34,,,"I thought it was more fitting to have the character look more westernized, such as in F or D, based upon their description and history.  This was the dominant factor, along with overall aesthetics, in how I made my rankings."
2561,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,I chose based on the well dressed and flamboyant elements of the character.
2562,Male,$61-100k,Black,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,I like option D the best because I think the way the character is dressed best represents his passion for wearing designer clothes.
2563,Male,$0-30k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,Options D and F look more average aged and relatable.
2564,Male,$61-100k,Asian,Graduate Degree,35-44,,,Option C is great with the casual look and the sword. Perfect description there. Option B is interesting and love the zen like pose with the sword there. Option A is a nice casual look with the series. Not as big a fan of options E and F. They seem too plain without a weapon. Option D with the gun doesn't do it for me.
2565,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,,,I like E. He seems believable and interesting. I don__ like the ones in the kimonos. They seems like you are leaning on a stereotype or something
2566,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,,,"I like the mix of traditional and modern in the way that the character is dressed. This is someone who respects the history and culture of his country, while using it to make himself appear more intimidating."
2567,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,I like option F the best because the picture looks most like a Yakuza boss.
2568,Male,$61-100k,Other,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,"I most prefer option B. The story is most unique and interesting to me personally. I felt like I had the best image of my head while reading B. I also most prefer the style of this same character just since he has that fighter look to him. The elements of the character being unique, and being aggressive attracted me the most for the characters."
2569,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,,,D is the most realistic of all of the images. F is really close to D. The different colors of E really set this one back. I do not imagine any Yakuza bosses wearing a Kimono robe at all. I would further say that belief that a Yakuza boss would wear a Kimono day in and day out is kind of a racist trope.
2570,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,,,I prefer shorter  jacket look
2571,Male,$31-60k,White,Associate Degree,25-34,,,This photo looks the best and shows the product in the best detail. It also attracts the most attention and stands out more
2572,Male,$61-100k,Asian,Graduate Degree,25-34,,,I ranked the designs of the Shinobu character that I liked the most.  I liked the design of option B's character the most followed by the design of the character of option A then option C.  I then liked option D's design followed by option F then finally option E.
2573,Male,$61-100k,Hispanic,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,I like this look the best as you can tell by his face that he means business. I also like the outfit that he has on. Another thing for me is that he has no weapons that you can see. As a gangster you dont need to flash the weapons like some of the other characters. People know who you are and what you are about without flashing a weapon.
2574,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,,,I prefer F and E. The style is over the top but there is a breadth of elegance and class. The others look a bit too rough.
2575,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,,,The two leys for me here was that me models himself after john gotti and wants to operate out of the west.  So this means he likes expensive and flashy clothing of a western style which the first two choices hit perfectly.
2576,Male,$31-60k,Asian,Graduate Degree,25-34,,,I prefer C over other options because the character in C is designed very authentic and unique
2577,Male,$31-60k,Black,Associate Degree,25-34,,,I like what looks like real street
2578,Male,$0-30k,Black,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,I like option F because it shows his flamboyant nature while also having a cool design at the same time
2579,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,"this is the order for me, i dont like it to be too extreme or streotypical"
2580,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,"I think D is the best of the options available, he really seems to give off the vibe of someone who does care about the appearance aspect but is also a really hardened criminal. I like the fact they all wanted to leave and start their own empires while modeling after the Don. I did not care for the characters with the swords, it just didn't seem to fit the story much at all."
2581,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,35-44,,,I prefer the more modern looking character design rather than the one in traditional Japanese garb.
2582,Male,$61-100k,Hispanic,Graduate Degree,45-54,,,"I would rank them in this order.  I think choice F fits the best because the look fits the ""dapper don"" reference in the description.  I like that it is a modernization of the yukuza, but also like that it keeps some elements of traditional Japan."
2583,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,"I like the ideas of c b and a but I feel like d f and e are more likely for this type of character. When I think of a yakuza boss, I think of d"
2584,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,This description and the character theme fit this style of games the best as they seem sinister yet cunning and all around the most interesting to me.
2585,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,45-54,,,I chose F as he looks the most liker John Gotti.  A and D are chosen next as they are the most western dressed.  B and C E are nice pictures but he looks too japanese traditional to fit the story.
2586,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,25-34,,,"The description says that he likes designer clothes and has styled himself after a mafia don and overall seems to idealize the west, so I believe F is the most congruent with something a mafia boss would wear. Option E is well-dressed and high class, but I don't think it fits with a mafia aesthetic, so I made it my second choice. Option D are western clothes, but overall they come off as more of a sleazy mid-ranking gang member than something a mafia boss, especially someone considered dapper, would wear. C, A, and B are all traditional Japanese clothing which I don't think fits someone who supposedly idealizes the west and western criminals, so in my opinion they are all equally bad choices."
2587,Male,$0-30k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,,,"Shinobu, we're told, is a fashionista with a love of fancy suits and a persona modeled on a Western don. It'd be odd for him to wear traditional Japanese dress, so A, C, and B are lower in the ranking. A has a certain sleekness and coldness in the head-on posture and the dead glare of Shinobu's sunglasses, while C cleverly combines elegant traditional dress with an extremely crude and ugly weapon: a crowbar. B comes in last for lacking either of those. E fits the concept better, but the suit looks garish instead of flamboyant and Shinobu looks to weather-beaten; he seems like someone who would shave and moisturize. F fits quite well, but the flannel on the scarf lessens the effect for me. He looks more like a Land's End model than a mob boss. D is great: flamboyant clothes, a dynamic pose, and a gun to indicate his criminality. It fits the concept really well and communicates that this is a dangerous man."
2588,Male,$31-60k,White,Graduate Degree,25-34,,,I read the backgrounds and looked at the art and this is my ranking from most interesting to least.
2589,Male,$101k+,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,,,"I like option D because it shows the crime boss as a style oriented person, as well as having a weapon at the ready."
2590,Male,$0-30k,White,High School,25-34,,,"E, looks like they fit the story very well. I find the stance and clothing choices look very confident and serious. I like the overall appearance of the character.F, this character looks very confident in his standing posture and clothing choice, I find the appearance to look  serious.A, this character looks very serious and potentially aggressive based on his posture and facial expression, and holding something behind his back.C, this character looks a little serious, however he looks aggressive based on holding the hook staff, and his stance looks embraced. I find the lower clothing choice makes me less interested based on the design pattern.B, this character makes me think of a ninja or martial arts person, however I find they don't evoke emotions or thoughts of a boss or leader.D, I find this character looks fairly aggressive based on the gun in his hand, and the overall stance looks leader like, with his confidence in having the upper shirt showing his chest. However I dislike the design pattern on his shirt.A,"
2591,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,"This story seems a bit more modern.  It reminds me of someone that I know.  Due to this, this is my top pick"
2592,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,This guy has nice style but hes not overdoing it with something like camo pants.  He also looks like he can be lethal in the event that someone triggers him.
2593,Male,$0-30k,Other,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,B is the only one I like because it doesn't seem to be based on anyone. I am pretty sure C is based on someone but not sure. But and A and D are clearly T.I. and Ja-Rule respectively.
2594,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,The character in A looks dangerous yet calm.  It's like he has done this forever and nothing bothers him.  He is just waiting to do what must be done.  His outfit is cool also.
2595,Male,$31-60k,White,Graduate Degree,25-34,,,Option A really stood out to me.  The description and the image fit together nicely.  I was really pleased with what was put forth in front of me with this pairing.  It is a good look for the game.
2596,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,45-54,,,The profile description indicates that Kevin is a troublesome guy but not really a gangsta. The style in C fits perfectly for the profile.
2597,Male,$0-30k,Hispanic,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,I feel with the background that is given that C is the most fitting design to the character. Also it has the best design to it.
2598,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,,,Based off the description I believe Kevin looks more like a young man who does not look too harden from the streets.  It seems like some of the other choices is more adults who have been harden up more.
2599,Male,$0-30k,White,High School,25-34,,,"I chose option C because I like the outfit style the best, I think the outfit is the most important element followed by the pose."
2600,Male,$0-30k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,Options B and C look more regular person looking type and can blend in better.
2601,Male,$61-100k,Asian,Graduate Degree,35-44,,,Kevin is best in option B. This looks the best and seems like the guy with the most character. I'd go with that look here first. Option A is not bad either for a tough guy and an older look. They seem to fit better for the images here.
2602,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,,,I chose option C because he looks like someone who has had a troubled childhood but is someone a bit misunderstood.  I like his face and clothing.
2603,Male,$31-60k,Asian,High School,35-44,,,Option A has kevin in basic street clothes and I think that fits his character the best.  Kevin doesn't seem to be a very flashy guy and just wants to get the job done so he wouldn't dress to stand out.
2604,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,25-34,,,"I thought C looked most like a younger partner that could be bossed around by a higher ranking gang member. Otherwise I felt the looks of D and B seemed a bit more hardened, which was also good given the street background."
2605,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,"He looks the most hardened in Option B and then Option C, which fits his profile of having lived in the streets in adolescence. Option B is my top choice because he seems to dress the most Urban style in terms of being a lover of music."
2606,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,25-34,,,Option C the visual graphics looks better on him
2607,Male,$61-100k,White,Associate Degree,35-44,,,I like option A because the character's clothing matches the best with the gang life description.
2608,Male,$61-100k,Black,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,I like Option C the best out of the four choices. Option C really seems to fit the mold of the description much better than the other choices. The other choices seem a lot more hardened than the description tells.
2609,Male,$61-100k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,I liked choice B since the character looks strong and confident while looks relevant to the description. Choice D looks more timid and not as strong or confident.
2610,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,i like that he is not done up too much in ganster sterotype
2611,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,,,I really like the facial expression of A and B.  It expresses someone who is resentful but maybe a little ashamed.
2612,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,,,B looks a little too stereotypical for the description. D is a good look for the description but I'm not a fan of the stocking cap. A is a great look but its a little dated. C is totally believable and an excellent fit.
2613,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,,,I prefer the ghetto lost look of the first 2. The baggy clothes and the hair in 2 as well. I think these two better fit his description. Also who is Jenner? Guy or girl? This could chnagr how he dresses.
2614,Male,$61-100k,Black,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,I like option D the best because he looks like he comes from an adoptive family background and still retains a little of that background due to how he dresses.
2615,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,"Option C most matches the description. The character conveys a look of confidence, and is well dressed. They have added personality, just based on their appearance."
2616,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,Option A best describes to the character presented. The image fits well with the theme.
2617,Male,$31-60k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,,,The camo pants and gray hoodie in my top choice make for an appropriate combination. I also like the textured green jacket in my second choice. Overall it's a cool set of designs for sure!
2618,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,"I think B shows that Kevin is kind of shy and reserved, which is how I would expect a person who was orphaned and not really cared for when a child.  He still has a tough look and is comfortable with a weapon, though."
2619,Male,$61-100k,Asian,Graduate Degree,25-34,,,I prefer Option A since the manner of dress and styling makes him look the most trustworthy out of the four designs. I didn't really care for the other 3 styles.
2620,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,,,I chose option A first because this character looks very strong and determined to get what he wants and I like the black jacket he is wearing. I chose option C second because this character looks intelligent and capable at what he does. I chose option B third because this character looks serious and confident in his actions and abilities but I do not like the camouflage pants very much. I chose option D last because this character looks incompetent and unable to do well in this society.
2621,Male,$0-30k,White,Graduate Degree,25-34,,,"option A looks like a hitman already, he does not look like some kind of guy who falls in love and like music. I like the option B since at least his clothes a little bit different than a normal gang member."
2622,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,,,I made my decision based upon the clothing the characters were wearing and how I envisioned someone with the background dressing.
2623,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,,,B seems most like someone who would enjoy music
2624,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,"Honestly, they all seem like offensive stereotypes and racist to me, I wouldn't play a game with any of these characters"
2625,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,"For a gang themed mobile game, Options A and B, in that order, are the best choices because they convey the impression that fits perfectly with the written description through attitude and dress."
2626,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,45-54,,,Option B has the better storyline and a good game cover.
2627,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,,,"I don__ like when your characters have celebrity faces that I recognize. When you do that, they don__ fit the story that you include. I didn__ recognize C, so it was my favorite,"
2628,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,25-34,,,I think that by his description he probably has a touch of sweetness to him. Option C is the picture that makes him look the least alarming or scary.
2629,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,,,I like the character's strong build. His bald head makes him more intimidating. This is a character who you want to have on your side. His style of dress seems more realistic as well.
2630,Male,$31-60k,Black,Associate Degree,25-34,,,"A gangster needs to look serious and dangerous, the way they hold a gun is vital as well."
2631,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,The weapon is the most prominently displayed in D and A so I was drawn there first
2632,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,The dude is not too flashy. Usually those are the guys you gotta watch out. I like characters that keep under the radar
2633,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,"This more fits his style.  The expression, combined with the attire gives me more of a feel for the character"
2634,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,I like option C because the image and story are all very realistic and easy to believe. I think that's what makes a good character.
2635,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,I like option D the best because he looks most like a gang member in the streets.
2636,Male,$61-100k,Asian,Graduate Degree,25-34,,,I ranked the designs of the character for Kevin that I liked the most.  I found the outfit of option C to be the most fitting for the character.  I then liked the design of the character of option A followed by option D and then finally option B.
2637,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,I like A because he looks like DMX in real life. Its a very realistic design and clothing style.
2638,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,The classic street look.  Cammo zipper hoodie. yankee hat.  choice B is pretty perfect
2639,Male,$31-60k,Asian,Graduate Degree,25-34,,,I choose C because in C the character looks casual but sill has some friendliness
2640,Male,$0-30k,White,High School,25-34,,,This guy looks the most intimidating yet still looks somewhat normal. I like the gun by the side rather than raised in the air.
2641,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,Choice C is the one that I feel matches with the description the best because he looks like he is the youngest and most inexperienced. The background story makes me think that Kevin is someone who is really young and has pretty much just joined the gang. Choice C looked the youngest to me and gave off those vibes. Choice B is second because he also looks young but came off to me as someone who is a bit more experienced and confident in the gang compared to Choice C. Choice B does give off the largest music lover vibes. Choice D is third because he looked to gangster in terms of being an experience member which the background story did not strike me as being. Choice A is last because he just looks too old to me to be Kevin. I am picturing Kevin as someone in their early 20s and he looks like he is in his 30s to me.
2642,Male,$0-30k,Hispanic,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,"With the description that is given I feel that C is the most fitting character design, and it does not try to do too much like the other options."
2643,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,"The character in D looks the most authentic to me.  He is muscular, tuff and looks like a bad ass.  The others look like want-a-be tuff guys"
2644,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,,,The Character presented in B almost seems very unreal and unbelievable. The Character from E seems more believable with the description. I could imagine the character from D being a little more realistic. The clothes from A really make sense. The character from C is the most believable of the bunch to go along with the description.
2645,Male,$31-60k,White,Graduate Degree,45-54,,,"If Baron Shaka hails from Rastafarian roots dating back to the 1960s, only Option A puts me in mind of that era and the 21st century, what with the green coat and the dreds. The other choices are simply less colorful in terms of clothing and more hard edged."
2646,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,25-34,,,"looks like a more interesting, dynamic character"
2647,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,,,"The most powerful gangster in H-Town, would be more flashy but also show colors of his roots in the clothing.   Choice B seems most representative with the flashy chains and weapon, but also shows his roots."
2648,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,"Option B is my favorite one by far because of the Jamaican colors, which fits the background story. In addition, it's the kind of over the top flair that is needed. The green and yellow colors and elements stand out to me the most. Option E is my least favorite because it seems like something out of Black Panther, particularly the hair style."
2649,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,45-54,,,THe style in A looks more like a Rastafarian and fits the profile. I like the style in B as it looks more gangsta. I wouldn't consider the style in D at all.
2650,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,25-34,,,"I thought C, D and E were all good portrayals of the character and I liked the intensity and outfit of C the most. I thought A and B didn__ depict enough intensity or competency in the character."
2651,Male,$61-100k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,I liked choice B and how confident the character looks. Also choice B matches the description of the character best and their island look. Choice E looks more bland and not as intimidating to look at.
2652,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,25-34,,,"I really hated option E to be honest. I didn't rank it last because Option B looked more like for a rap video shoot. I guess it's a decent idea for a game, but a golden gun? I ranked E and B last for those reasons. I thought E was like a photoshopped face onto his face, and it was BAD!I thought option D made the most sense. If this character is as ruthless as you say, I think the facial expressions and the posture in option D really speaks gangster to me!"
2653,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,i think this order makes them look the best without being to sterotypical
2654,Male,$0-30k,White,High School,25-34,,,"E, I find the appearance looks fairly basic, they could blend into a crowd fairly easy. I like the clothing choices of this character.A, I fin d the color of the clothing stands out, I dislike the color green a lot, and the overall appearance looks fairly basic.D, the open t-shirt shows that this character is confident and the tattoos and the appearance of this character looks authoritative.B, the gun appears to have gold plating, and the clothing makes me think that the character is a boss, however they also seem to be more iconic or what films would show as a boss, not necessarily a true boss.C, I dislike the clothing choices, it would be very easily to blend in, however the texture stands out, and the character does not make me think of a boss."
2655,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,,,I like A the best.  He looks stylish and memorable without being too much of a Jamaican stereotype.
2656,Male,$61-100k,White,Vocational Training,25-34,,,I like Option D the best.  Baron Shaka looks the most aggressive in this photo. I like that you are also able to see his tattoo's in the image very well too.
2657,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,"Overall option D is the best fit. The character conveys a look of confidence, and an attention grabbing demeanor. They look well detailed, original, and more memorable."
2658,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,"To be honest, there was not necessarily a huge reason why I selected Option-C as my first choice other than the fact that I thought the characters' overall look just fit the best with the plot of the game."
2659,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,"I feel like the leader of the gang would be flashy with a mean spirit, and the gold chains and gold gun really portray that."
2660,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,"I liked e the best and chose it because after reading the description I think it's the best. The gun toting criminal looks just that, and I think this would fit the game really well."
2661,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,I made my choices based on fashion. The outfit designs I liked best were prioritized. Option B stood out from the rest.
2662,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,I like option C because he looks and seems much more badass than the others. I think he would be a tough character to beat.
2663,Male,$61-100k,Black,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,I like option B the best because I like the way the character is dressed.  He looks like he is a leader to me.
2664,Male,$61-100k,Asian,Graduate Degree,35-44,,,Baron Shaka looks great as a character and a tough guy. I like the portrayal for each of these. Option B has the best character and love the way he holds the weapon there. That look is fierce and has a lot of character. Option A is not bad and he looks more sly and daring here. Good look there too. Option E is a great look but less pizazz overall. I think options C and D are too boring here.
2665,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,"Based on this gang-themed mobile game concept, Options B and A are my preferred choices because the attitudes and demeanors and costumes and weapons convey the image of a tough enforcer."
2666,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,"The gaze of this person, combined with the posture, gives him an intimidating look.  He fits the profile best due to these features"
2667,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,,,I think in the last one he looks more like a pimp and less like a like a boss.. I think the others are all nice but I prefer the jacket especially in the 1st 1.. I think it gives him a more authoritarian look.
2668,Male,$61-100k,Hispanic,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,I feel like B is the one as the style that his outfit shows and how he is carrying himself will fit more closely to what I imagine being someone with the characters background. I think that D is a close second and C is the worst one as the character is just off.
2669,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,This character seems like the most conniving based on image.
2670,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,,,"I like his outfit and hairstyle the most. He looks mean, but also like he's someone important. I like the touch of having some gold chains around his neck. It shows off his wealth without being too over the top."
2671,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,25-34,,,"I love the outfit that he is wearing in option B, it pays homage to his jamaican roots and makes him look like a bad man."
2672,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,,,"I like what your trying to do with the two last place choices with the weed dealing thing, they have a bit of that stoner vibe to them but they just dont look like they could lead a gang.  The first and second place choice make the most sense because they first and foremost actually look tough like a gangster, particularly a leader, generally would."
2673,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,"I liked the story behind B, but I would be cautious with the racial undertones of your gang member"
2674,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,I think that he looks better dressed nicely like in E and C. I think B is too colorful and I don't imagine him having that flashy of clothing when he runs a drug gang. I also feel D is too dressed down and he would have too much money to dress like this. I like E the best because of the leather jacket. I don't care as much for the camo pants in C but the rest is nice.
2675,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,The guy looks well dressed. He doesn't look like a total psycho. Those are the ones you really gotta watch out with. I think it'll work well for the game
2676,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,35-44,,,"I think the character in D with his outfit and gun are the most appealing, i would go with that one based on visual design"
2677,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,"I think D looks like the most brutal leader, so that's my choice."
2678,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,"Choice E is the one that fits best to me because he looks like he would lead the gang with a firm and iron hand. He is well dressed but not to an outlandish point or anything like that. So you still know that he is someone important. His look and expression and demeanor are that of someone who is serious, firm and does not like to deal with nonsense or traitors. Choice C is second because his look and style blends in more compared to Choice E. He looks like someone who is serious and runs the gang with an iron fist but would be more quick to snap in anger and retaliation. Choice D is third because his look is more of that of a brutal right hand enforcer to me as opposed to the leader of a gang. Choice A has the same issue as Choice D regarding the look not matching the leader role. This look seems more like that of a young, inexperienced but still up and coming member of the gang. Choice B is last because while he looks like the leader of a gang his look is more flashy, outlandish and flamboyant to me as opposed to the type that would lead with a serious iron hand."
2679,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,,,I like C. He's dressed in a way that I see as believable. I like that he looks a little older too.
2680,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,45-54,,,"A has the best features and better design, the unique style and the rare elements is appealing."
2681,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,the character should looks tough as nails but also have a bit of dapperness to him.   The character should have the IDGAF attitude too.  D shows this off extremely well.
2682,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,I like the ones that seem more mean and urban and less stylish and blinged up
2683,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,,,"I feel C fits the bill the best. He has the look and supposed demeanor that matches the description. Also, the outfit really ties in well."
2684,Male,$0-30k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,I like his design in option D the best. I like how his clothing looks rugged with the way he wears them. He looks scary and powerful.
2685,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,I chose option E as my favorite because the character reminded me of the bad guy in the Black Panther movie played by Michael B Jordan.  I think it would be cool to play with this character in the game.
2686,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,c as c is most represnted by movies as being a gangster/mafia look
2687,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,"I really liked the look of B, he looked tough and cool and more what I would expect given the description. C is also a good option, a bit more plain but I would believe seeing them in the role. The rest were all pretty good as well, the only I really didn't like much was E. Just didn't look as tough."
2688,Male,$0-30k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,"As the ""boss"" of a gang, I would expect the person to be really flamboyant and flashy to stick out and attract attention. Option B does exactly that, where the character exudes personality, charisma and is decked out in expensive looking items."
2689,Male,$31-60k,White,Associate Degree,25-34,,,I think what he's wearing symbolizes the strengths he has and more of a leadership toner to him while still striking fear.
2690,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,I think option B the best because the character looks most like a gang member.
2691,Male,$61-100k,Other,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,I think option D fits the best. This story is one that intrigues me and would make sense as far as a gang goes.
2692,Male,$0-30k,Other,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,B looks the most crooked to me. C does too but look like Hopper from Stranger Things which could be an issue. A seems the least crooked.
2693,Male,$0-30k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,"The full uniform being worn in Option A really adds an extra ""sinister"" look to him, while still making him look clean cut compared to the others. The description implies someone who is calculating, and wouldn't want to stick out in the wrong way. Therefore, the most ""normal"" looking guy would be a perfect match."
2694,Male,$0-30k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,C because his facial expression looks the most like a bad guy and crooked cop. A also looks a little evil while B looks the most neutral or possible good guy.
2695,Male,$0-30k,Hispanic,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,I feel that A has the most realistic design to it that makes it the most pleasing to look at.
2696,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,Option B is the best choice because the man looks the most believable and intimidating this way. Option C does a good job as the second best option. Option B just looks a little too professional.
2697,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,,,I chose option A because the traditional police uniform and cap kind of sell the character to me.
2698,Male,$61-100k,Asian,Graduate Degree,25-34,,,Option b is the only one without that ridiculous shield. This one looks like a cop without going too far in reminding you the character is a crooked cop.
2699,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,25-34,,,Option B looks like he would be the most corrupt cop.
2700,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,,,"Most cops don't wear hats like this anymore day in and day out, especially not with riot gear as pictured in A. The shield in B is far more accurate of a look but this officer is too clean cut. I find the officer in C to be the most realistic with the caveat that the shield pictured does not really make as much sense in context and if I had my druthers I would take the shield from B and give it to the cop in C."
2701,Male,$61-100k,White,Associate Degree,35-44,,,I like option B because the character looks like he could have a bad side along with a normal look.
2702,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,"I like the one with the long shield most.  After that, I prefer the ones without a police cap on.  This makes them look more crooked/disloyal to the police force."
2703,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,I like the image of bee because he has more of the riot gear shield. It tells me things are bad and he__ going to have to kick some butt.  Of course with everything going on in the media right now vilifying cops with prime out of control the overall theme of this game is a little tone deaf in my opinion
2704,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,,,"They would all be good, but B and C look more ""crooked""."
2705,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,,,I like option B because it seems like the toughest character and I like the detail in the face. I then like the detail in C over A.
2706,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,,,Option B shows the roughest cop I think who does not care and really just wants money.
2707,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,,,"i like all of these. i think that the meanest looking ones are 1 and 2 though. i like the thicker, rougher look of 1 though, as well as the type of police shield. this one says to me more - a man of the streets. 2 and 3 are both good also though"
2708,Male,$61-100k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,I liked choice B the best since the cop doesn't look like a traditional cop and has a stronger and larger shield which looks appealing and eye catching. Choice A looks like a traditional cop with the hat and their facial feature which makes them look generic.
2709,Male,$61-100k,Hispanic,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,I like this style the most as this is the one that to me would lead to bigger and better battles. If you look at the character there is a lot of toughness with the way he looks and the shield he has with him to go along with the baton. I just think that this screams business when it comes to his battling abilities.
2710,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,"Option B looks more like that unfaithful, sleezebag cop that would have that backstory rather than the other cops based on his appearance"
2711,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,Option B definitely looked most like a crooked cop. He just kind of looked like an asshole and definitely fit he description given.
2712,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,35-44,,,B and C are great. A looks too clean cut and by the book. B and C I can see both as being crooked I do think B looks better but I prefer C's shield more
2713,Male,$61-100k,Other,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,I most prefer option B because the large shield is really cool. The idea that the shield could be hidden behind while crouching down is pretty awesome.
2714,Male,$0-30k,White,High School,25-34,,,"B, his overall appearance makes me feel he has rougher or more aggressive reactions.A, the appearance makes me feel that he is a more aggressive argumentative character.C, this character looks fairly calm and relaxed, he makes me feel less worried."
2715,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,,,I picked based on how scary looking and official looking and actually intimidating looking the police character models looked.
2716,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,I love B he looks tough and can handle anything. A looks a little to week. C is way too weak.
2717,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,I chose c first because the guy has look on his face like he has done a lot of things wrong in his life matching the description
2718,Male,$61-100k,Black,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,I think the character best fits the description because in real life I know big burly guys like this who have done the exact same thing as in the description.
2719,Male,$31-60k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,,,C to me looks the most like what I envision as  a rogue dirty cop. A with the hat looks too much like a regular police officer who is not on the take. B reminds me too much of Brock Lesnar!
2720,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,Option B is the most appealing overall. The characters demeanor fits the description well. He gives off the type of vibes that I would associate with somebody you have to watch out for.
2721,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,"These all seem like relatively good designs for this character, but option B is the most visually imposing and intriguing to me. The other two seem menacing, but option B just seems more dangerous."
2722,Male,$31-60k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,,,The yellow lettering on the shield in my top choice adds a nice accent to the image. Very cool design for sure!
2723,Male,$0-30k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,Option B of the shield not having any logo/insignia creates the sense the department is underfunded and fighting their hardest with whatever they have.
2724,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,"I think the look on his face in A definitely shows his lack of compassion for anyone but himself.  He looks most ready to use the baton in a crooked way in A as well, compared to the other options."
2725,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,45-54,,,I chose A because I like the tom hardy character.  I chose brock lesnar second.  C is last because I hate that guy.
2726,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,,,I like that A doesn__ have a face that I recognize. The Brock lens Armand the cop from stranger things throw off my perception. I don__ recognize A and appreciate the originality
2727,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,45-54,,,"The face in option B looks wicked and selfish, just like the profile."
2728,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,I like option B and the rectangular shield. I think that looks more realistic. It is what I see on the news often.
2729,Male,$101k+,White,High School,35-44,,,"C looks like a modern riot cop who attacks mostly peaceful protesters.  He fits the description well, and looks modern.  B similarly look corrupt, though a little bit dated.  A looks quite dated, and like a generic cop from decades past."
2730,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,I feel that the guys in both B and C look like the right amount of toughness for what this person is going through. I think that B looks like Brock Lesner and I like that he has muscles and a tattoo. I think this person is a very bad guy and needs to look tough to make him worrisome.
2731,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,I chose based on which character I thought looked most crooked.
2732,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,The uniform is the best uniform tonl represent the game. I would choose it because it stands out the most to me.
2733,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,25-34,,,I love option A the most because this character most fits the vibe of the description the best.
2734,Male,$0-30k,White,High School,35-44,,,"The face, hair, and overall look of option C are clear winners.  He appears as someone who is crooked or bent with a rugged look and rough and tumble attitude."
2735,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,"B seems the most like a corrupt cop to me, he just looks like a jerk. C is second just because A seems the least like a corrupt cop, C looks well put together and his uniform is the most put together so he seems legit."
2736,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,B looks kinda like brock lesnar. Pretty tough looking!
2737,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,25-34,,,I think C seems the most crooked and selfish looking. I also liked the larger stature of C and B relative to A.
2738,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,25-34,,,"I think that option B makes him look like the most capable to fight in a video game, he just looks like a bad man in option B."
2739,Male,$0-30k,White,High School,25-34,,,I think that this option looks more rugged and badass like I would think it should look.
2740,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,Option B is my top choice from these three because this character looks more like a crooked cop based on his appearance and demeanor.
2741,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,,,"Given the description, a pathetic coward like that would hide behind the biggest shield he could get.  Barring that, he'd hide behind one that wasn't see through.  So B, A C is the order from best to worst."
2742,Male,$0-30k,Other,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,C and B look the most believable looks I feel. They match the story the best being not standing out too much and being someone who was in school. A is and D are too much and would have to be this character later on in his life but not so much now.
2743,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,,,"I like option B the most because it seems to fit the character the most and is most authentic. I then think A fits next best, followed by C and D."
2744,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,,,I chose B because given his back story I think he doesn't call too much attention to himself and I think B is the most grounded and down to earth design.
2745,Male,$0-30k,Hispanic,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,I feel that B has the most fitting look with the description that is giving. It also looks like it is the most realistic look to him.
2746,Male,$0-30k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,A fits best for a college dropout who is now hanging out in Ktown and is close friends with the leader of a gang. I prefer the style of A because  he doesn't look like an obvious criminal but also doesn't look like a nerd like B and C.
2747,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,"I chose option A because the profile best fits what this character should be. Option B was a good second choice, but it was just not as good as A. Option D and option C both have outfits that do not fit the type of person this character should be appearing as."
2748,Male,$0-30k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,"I don't think the character would be proud of his ""failure"" at MIT, so Option C is off the table for me. Option D looks too much like a ""criminal,"" also knocking that one out. Options B and A fit the character the most in that both look like normal, working class guys. However, Option B fits the description more as he looks a little more down on his luck and unmotivatedd, like the description implies."
2749,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,He's stylish yet edgy in Option D and seems more in line with being a drop out yet intelligent.
2750,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,,,"C is last because the image came up with a broken image icon and I was not able to make a good decision on it. Although the image for B is probably most realistic, it's also kind of boring. D is also not great as it seems to evoke 90's memories of images referring to Korean gang bangers. A really looks like the most interesting image of the bunch"
2751,Male,$61-100k,Asian,Graduate Degree,25-34,,,Option d is the only one where it really seems like this is person is actually korean. I've seen alot of people have the same look at option d making it feel more authentic.
2752,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,25-34,,,I think Option B is the best choice. He looks like he wouldn't stand out compared to some of the other flashier models.
2753,Male,$61-100k,White,Associate Degree,35-44,,,I like option C because the characters outfit resembles a person of his age group the best.
2754,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,Options B and C fit the description while also keeping the character inconspicuous.  Options A and D make the character look too gangster and obvious.
2755,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,In D The character looks a little tougher. However the entire theme of the game is really stupid in my opinion someone from MIT dropped out is now selling designer handbags and that__ their big criminal activity. Sounds really boring
2756,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,,,"I think the character will look mostly normal and does not try to draw attention.   Has a great education but at the sametime is a criminal.  Thus, smart enough to be simple."
2757,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,,,"i think in 4, by having an MIT sweatshirt it makes him look smarter as though he graduated. 1 and 2 both look a bit more mysterious, and 1 looks a bit booky. the baggy pants i think add to his look. 2 looks good and gives him a mysterious air."
2758,Male,$101k+,White,Vocational Training,25-34,,,"I like the design on A the most, it__ reminds me most of a college kid even though C was wearing an MIT hoodie. I don__ feel like a budding gang member would actually show off that he went to college"
2759,Male,$61-100k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,I liked choice A since they look ready to fight and looks the strongest. Choice C looks plain and nothing interesting or unique about them.
2760,Male,$61-100k,Hispanic,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,"Due to where he came from I think this is a style that would fit him very much. I think that this is a common look for many people who come from modest beginnings. Since he has started at such a young age, the look is fitting. Plus he can keep what he does on the low if he doesnt change to a flashy look or something out of the ordinary for someone with his background."
2761,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,Most of them actually looked really corny to me. Option B was the only one that actually kind of looked normal and I didn't feel looked out of place.
2762,Male,$61-100k,Other,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,I most prefer option A. The outfit is cool looking but doesn't cover too much of the face like option D does. Option D would be my pick if the eyes were not covered.
2763,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,,,I thought the first 2 choices that I picked made the character more down to earth and not too outlandish and obnoxious looking which was something I liked.
2764,Male,$0-30k,White,High School,25-34,,,"A, he wears clothing that tends to hide most of his appearance and makes him blend in easier with others around. The way he is playing with the card stack makes me feel that he really understands what he is doing.B, the clothing that the characters wears hides much of his appearance and makes it easy for him to blend in with the surrounding others. He looks fairly smart based on his appearance, and holding cards makes me feel his is fairly confident.D, this characters has some slightly unique clothing choices that make him stand out more, others might take notice of him more easily, however he has an appearance that still makes me think that he is in a gang based on his stance and posture.C, this characters looks fairly relaxed and calm, he shows confidence in his card skills by throwing them into the air, and the clothing he wears is fairly basic and doesn't really catch my attention."
2765,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,A fits him best he's not to overdressed or underdressed. He fits in with this look in A.
2766,Male,$101k+,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,,,He is smart and korean so he would be wearing MIT stuff even though he dropped out. Msot people do not know what he is doing so he ill look innocent. C shos this. A and B show common dont stand out clothes D is too gan related he would not wear those if he is hiding what he truly does and is smart
2767,Male,$61-100k,Black,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,I like option C the best because I think that if he works in a fake designer bag factory that he would have an affinity for dressing nice.
2768,Male,$31-60k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,,,"A seems to be how someone of this age and background would normally dress, jeans and a hoodie. B isn't bad but he looks too much like Glenn from the Walking Dead. C looks kind of goofy and out of place, it just doesn't work. D is way too over the top, nobody dresses like that."
2769,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,"Option C seems to match the description the best, in my opinion; it depicts the character exactly as described and is visually exciting. Options D and A are suitable, but neither has the same allure as option C. Option B is the only one that doesn't fit the description."
2770,Male,$31-60k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,,,"The gray jacket and baggy pants in my top choice stood out, and the bucket hat is a nice touch as well. Very cool design for sure!"
2771,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,"Based on the description. The character that most matches would be option A. The look has a mysterious appeal to him, but he also looks like somebody that is always on the lookout for opportunity, in various ways."
2772,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,35-44,,,Option C seems to fit the description the best. It has style but also still has some class and young fashion thrown in.
2773,Male,$0-30k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,Options A and B of a hoodie jacket look more like the average person and blends in well with everyone.
2774,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,,,"Well, the MIT shirt fits the best with that detail of the story, but any of the three where the guy looks like a regular guy in his early 20s looks good to me.  The guy with the big floppy hat doesn't match the description at all to me though."
2775,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,I think Kim's intellect and history at MIT is reflected really well in his more clean cut style of dress.  It also hides his criminal intents and activities really well.  The bag he is wearing looks like it could have come from the factory he works at too.
2776,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,,,"I don__ like the hat over the eyes in D. It__ not MIT university. It__ just MIT. I don__ like C as a result. B was my favorite, I found it most realistic and believable. I could see a real person looking like that"
2777,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,45-54,,,"With the profile narrated, I feel the style in C is the best match because Kim is somewhat educated and smart but also a criminal."
2778,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,"I like option A because the character looks like someone very smart, but also not very motivated. Its very fitting. I also think with him playing with the cards makes him think he's cool."
2779,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,"I like my top choice by far the most as it makes him look like a normal student and not like he would be involved in crime. My next two choices I liked equally, as the both just kind of look like normal clothing for someone his age. I really don't like the bottom option as it makes him stand out too much."
2780,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,I think the MIT sweatshirt is a good touch.
2781,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,45-54,,,I chose B because he looks normal and in the shadows.  C is also a good choice but the MIT sweatshirt is a little to much.  A looks too much like a teenager which he is not.  D just looks like an idiot.
2782,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,I don't care for the style of hat he has in D and how it fits his character. I don't think he would wear an MIT shirt like he is in C. I like the look of both B and A with the grey sweatshirt and the backpack. I think he looks better with the hood down in B but both look similar and nice.
2783,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,35-44,,,"A and B are great, I see him as dressing low key and modest to not get attention, i see him as more of listener then talker and very clever. C is also really good but I prefer the first 2. D fels wrong to me. I just do not see him dressing like a classic gangsta,"
2784,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,25-34,,,I love option D the most because the way he dresses signals that he couldn't adjust well to college and that he is part of crime.
2785,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,The outfit in C fits with the characters background and seems realistic
2786,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,"A seems the best to me, I like the hoodie look with the whole thing. I do like C but I think the MIT sweater might be a bit much, it would be a tell and I don't think a criminal would wear something like that. B is about the same as A but he doesn't look confident. D just looks dumb to me, mentally that is, also I hate bucket hats."
2787,Male,$0-30k,White,High School,25-34,,,I think that this option looks unassuming and would make for the best character twists.
2788,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,25-34,,,I thought A and C did a better job conveying the smart and cunning nature of the character. But I chose A as the best since C looked a bit too trustworthy.
2789,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,25-34,,,"I like that he is wearing a MIT sweatshirt in option C, it also looks like he is a normal kid that no one would suspect would be into crime."
2790,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,,,I like the images where he is portrayed more like a normal young adult. I liked him wearing a baseball cap and hoodie. The images of him as a nerd or gangster are too over the top and feel more like stereotypes.
2791,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,"Options C and A, in that order, best fit the description provided because of the character appearance and demeanor and the clothing and use of cards."
2792,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,35-44,,,"I think with the way hes dressed this way he looks the most normal, and like he would be part of an illegal boxing ring.  The others look too over the top."
2793,Male,$0-30k,Hispanic,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,I feel that B's design meshes the best with the name and backstory of the character.
2794,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,I think option B matches best the character looks more worked over and has blood on him.  It matches the synopsis more.
2795,Male,$61-100k,Asian,Graduate Degree,25-34,,,Option C has the character displayed as a huge immidinating character that towers over potential oppoents. Love the look and love all the little details shown.
2796,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,I like that option A shows a bit of pride in his home by using the national colors in the outfit. I also like the traditional tattoo.
2797,Male,$101k+,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,,,I prefer option C because it looks like he has had a rough life and had to fight to get to wear he is today like his background describes.   The others look a little to clean cut and pristine for the bio provided.
2798,Male,$0-30k,White,High School,35-44,,,I think that this option is most fitting of the story of a boxer that also brawls in a underground club more than the other options
2799,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,"All 4 designs fit the character well, but I really think my top 2 choice best reflect the character's name and description."
2800,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,The hand wraps of B and the robe of C are the two best. B looks like a savage. D is pretty plain and he shouldn__ be champ yet so that A
2801,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,,,"C is the best as the story is quite sad and depicts Eric as coming from poor, rough roots and not really wanting to fight. C's demeanor captures this the best with the scar, the forlorn look on his face, and his drooped head. A is the next best option as he is also drooping his head and looks a bit dejected. D and B don't work as well, as both seem eager to fight and full of pride."
2802,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,This description best fits the character and draws me in to his story. His design is the best as well.
2803,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,25-34,,,I love option A the most because it makes him look the most trained as a fighter as well as looking the most badass.
2804,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,,,A- looks like an OK guy with a human (not superhuman)  build - that seems most like the back story.  D & C at least don't look like crazy killers although they're so huge they look like world champions or superheroes instead of real people. B - what's with the shiv?  This guy looks like a villain.
2805,Male,$61-100k,Hispanic,Graduate Degree,45-54,,,I would rank them in this order with choice A as my preferred choice.  I like choice A because I think it fits the background the best.  I like how the colors of the mexican flag are used in the image.  It has a feeling of authenticity to it.
2806,Male,$31-60k,Other,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,I like the mexican colors on the boxer its a fitting look for him
2807,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,35-44,,,"I just kind of had to go with my gut here, tough to describe exactly how the story made me think of each model... but after reading I just went with what made ""sense"" to me."
2808,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,25-34,,,"looks the most intimidating, fun, and macho"
2809,Male,$101k+,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,,,"I ranked my choices based on which option best represented his background, so the option with the Mexican flag colors was my first choice."
2810,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,,,I chose option A because I think it does a good job dealing with his background and heritage.  I like the Mexican colors of his cape and shorts.  Option B is decent as well with a more grounded look.
2811,Male,$0-30k,Black,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,Maybe it's just the longer hair but Options A and D are my favorites by a long shot. I particularly love the Mexican flag inspired ring gear for Option A. Options A and D look the coolest but I believe Option B does still fit the character well. Option C is last and least.
2812,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,45-54,,,There is something about the style in option C that screams 'ready to devour any opponent'. Option A in a sense also has the attribute.
2813,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,,,I ranked them in order of how menacing they look.
2814,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,I think C is the best looking one and fits. Next would be B. A is my least favorite.
2815,Male,$0-30k,Black,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,"Options A and B have a lot more facial features associated with Mexicans. Option A, in particular, is wearing colors that are associated with Mexico."
2816,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,"Eric sounds like a fundamentally good guy who has always been too close to shady stuff to fully avoid it.  As such, option B looks most correct.  B seems like a good guy who isn't trying to be something he isn't, and maybe isn't all the way happy about where he is in life.  Option C is the worst.  For one, there is no way that guy is 22 years old, and for two, option D and C both look like characters who are satisfied with their criminality and embrace that identity."
2817,Male,$0-30k,White,High School,35-44,,,"I chose these just according to the story, but actually the two that I chose last are my favorites aesthetically overall, I just think the first choice fits the story best"
2818,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,"I like the weapon that B is holding, the belt on A's waist, and the angle/pose of D"
2819,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,I like option A the best because the picture of him with the championship belt on stands out the most to me.
2820,Male,$101k+,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,,,"Looks more like a street fighter that might actually be in illegal fights, instead of looking like a superhero."
2821,Male,$31-60k,White,Graduate Degree,25-34,,,"I think that character design looks the coolest and most fitting to the story. If I read that description, I'd picture that guy."
2822,Male,$101k+,White,Graduate Degree,45-54,,,"Given Eric's tough upbringing and his Mexican heritage, I believe this is the best option, because it shows him as a buff, strong, no-nonsense kind of person, and his gloves, cape, shoes, and shorts are adorned in the colors of the Mexican flag, helping to underscore his background and his home country."
2823,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,I like B more than the other choices because this character does not seem that intelligent and B looks the closest to that stereotype in my mind.  I really like the brooding nature of B and to a lesser extent C.  I want this character to be unhappy because that fits better.
2824,Male,$61-100k,Black,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,I like option C the best because I think the character looks like he came from a rough background.
2825,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,,,I chose panel C.  I really like this photo of him in the cape.
2826,Male,$0-30k,White,Graduate Degree,25-34,,,"Deep down he is a decent guy who loves his family, especially his brother. So, we should look like a tough looking guy physically, but his face should also show the softness, like in B and A. In option D and C he looks like a murderer"
2827,Male,$0-30k,White,High School,35-44,,,"The overall design and color choices for the outfit really sell the Mexican heritage. The fire pattern on the robe is especially compelling. Overall, this design really fits the character and background."
2828,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,I like the depiction of the Mexican flag in the theme A
2829,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,I just would pick the biggest dude who looks like he'd wreck everyone. Mike Haggar em up. Dude's not too smart being a coke mule with condoms up his poop chute.
2830,Male,$31-60k,Asian,Graduate Degree,35-44,,,Option D is the clear cut choice here. The image is believable unlike Option A which has a ridiculous costume. Option C is not Mexican looking enough.
2831,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,,,I really like the Mexican flag colors on his outfit in A. That one is my favorite. I think it looks really cool. I also like the tattoos and appreciate the patriotism
2832,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,My favorite is the character in Option A and thats because he looks very much fierce and has a title.
2833,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,45-54,,,"The Eric story was really inspirational and motivational, but his dedication to his life is really touching therefore his background fits well into the game."
2834,Male,$61-100k,White,Associate Degree,35-44,,,I like option A because the character with a championship belt makes them look stronger.
2835,Male,$61-100k,White,High School,45-54,,,"I think that the characters shown in options B & D both fit the descriptions very well, with option B fitting the best....he looks battle scarred in the face, and he also looks very tough and hardened in his face and eyes as well. the hands being bloody and wrapped up is also a good addition to him also. I would pick option D as a very close second, as he looks very hardened and kinda has the Danny Trejo vibe to him, which is a great thing."
2836,Male,$0-30k,White,High School,25-34,,,I think C is the best because it seems like a guy who would participate in an underground brawl club and is doing it to support his family. B also isn't that bad and fits the description. I don't really like D or A but A feels like a caricature so I ranked D above it.
2837,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,I like the clothing design and style of this iteration of the character.  His clothes look festive and designed well and his stance let's you know he is humble will still beat anyone up.
2838,Male,$0-30k,Other,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,A looks the coolest and helps sells the fact that he is Mexican the most. C and D are nice designs too. B is the weakest though. Nothing really stands out.
2839,Male,$61-100k,White,High School,25-34,,,"I think in most of the options Eric doesn't look twenty-two. Certainly, he has had a hard life, but a 22 year old will usually have a fresher face. I think D shows that the best. It looks almost like he has that facial tattoo to look tougher. Pretty well thought of character art. Option A is fairly decent because it obscures his face a bit more, so there's not too many wrinkles or gauntness and the chest tattoo looks amazing. I also think the outfit is pretty striking. I like the face of Option B, but he just looks a bit too old for his character description. C by far has the coolest outfit for an illegal boxer, but Eric looks a bit too battle-worn for someone so young."
2840,Male,$61-100k,Asian,Graduate Degree,35-44,,,Option A has the most heart and love for Mexico. I would use him first. Love the look and he seems aggressive and loyal to his country. Excellent here. Option D is a badass too. I like his braids here. Great design for this guy and think it's a wonderful look. Option B is a nice look and reminds me a bit of Canelo Alvarez. Could be the ticket as well. Option C is decent but doesn't really have the Mexican flair to him.
2841,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,,,I think the last one has volunteered number 1 and number 2 are my favorite ones I really like number 2 with the Mexican flag but I think number 1 is a little bit dirty to look and matches the description a bit more.
2842,Male,$61-100k,Asian,Graduate Degree,25-34,Role Playing; Adventure; Action,,sassy spunky and cute. if the game is played in their person even better as you can look at your character as much as you want.
2843,Male,$31-60k,Asian,High School,18-20,Adventure; Simulation; Action,,"Option B is the best as she is the most attractive. The next most attractive is the harley quinn look alike in D, then A and finally C."
2844,Male,$0-30k,Hispanic,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Sports; Adventure; Action,,"C I feel looks like they are prepped, and know what they are doing for the apocalypses. That is why it is my top choice."
2845,Male,$0-30k,Asian,High School,18-20,Music; Simulation; Action,,Option C and B looks more rebellious than other Options presented here.
2846,Male,$101k+,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Sports; Board; Puzzle,,I prefer option C because the character looks more serious and would be in a more serious and involved game.
2847,Male,$31-60k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Adventure; Card; Role Playing; Simulation; Strategy,,B and D were my favorite as they seem to have the most spunk in them.
2848,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,25-34,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Racing; Simulation,,I love option C the most because it looks the most badass and it has a machine gun making me tougher.
2849,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Casino; Educational; Card; Puzzle; Simulation,,"If the game wants immersion, I am going from most realistic to least realistic."
2850,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,35-44,Casino; Adventure; Arcade; Action; Role Playing,,"My top pick has that scavenger look which makes sense given the type of world shes in, the others look out of place."
2851,Male,$0-30k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Board; Card,,I prefer option D looks visually appealing. I find the character face stands out more.
2852,Male,$0-30k,White,High School,25-34,Action,,I think that option c looks the most realistic and convincing for a post apocalyptic type world. option d is the worst because it is too cartoony.
2853,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Adventure; Role Playing; Strategy; Simulation,,"I only really liked B, because it seems more realistic, given what I'm able to see of the background; the other images barely match their landscape, with a possible exception for C"
2854,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Adventure; Strategy; Casino; Role Playing; Trivia,,"I really like my top choice because it looks like Harley Quinn and really stand out in this group. I dislike my bottom choice because she is the least physically appealing to look at. The other two are okay, but I think a character looks cooler with less rather than more."
2855,Male,$0-30k,White,High School,25-34,Arcade; Card; Educational; Strategy; Puzzle,,I am more of a fan of the weird look that is used here for the character in a natural setting in all black like in C and A
2856,Male,$0-30k,White,High School,25-34,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Music; Puzzle,,I picked D and C as my top choices as I like how the characters look like they are very fun to play with.
2857,Male,$0-30k,White,High School,25-34,Action; Role Playing; Strategy,,Harley Quinn look alike looks like a good apocalypse  char
2858,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,25-34,Casino,,looks the most funky and cool overall!
2859,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,25-34,Action; Casino; Arcade; Trivia,,"I love the hair due in option A, I also like that she is kind of a bad ass but is still super sexy with her cleavage."
2860,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Arcade; Strategy,,"I like the characters that look well armed and prepared for a post apocalyptic world.  The other characters are attractive, but don't look like they'd survive long."
2861,Male,$0-30k,White,Graduate Degree,25-34,Action; Arcade; Sports,,"I like this option most because the individual looks to be heavily armed, which is what I would expect under these circumstances."
2862,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Word,,I still want an action character that shoots guns.  My top 2 choice look the best and my last choice looks too much like Harley Quinn in my opinion.
2863,Male,$61-100k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,21-24,Role Playing; Adventure; Action,,I liked choice C the best because it looks realistic and has a cool soldier-esk theme that fits the world well. I liked choices A and B a little less because they both toned down the realism to a degree. Choice D looks cool but is too inspired and not really original.
2864,Male,$0-30k,Hispanic,Associate Degree,21-24,Simulation; Strategy; Arcade; Adventure; Action,,I think that from my first option to my last is the order in which I find the outfit designs to be fitting for the type of world described. I like the armored look of the first design quite a bit.
2865,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Adventure; Puzzle; Role Playing; Strategy,,I chose option C because I think this character looks the most like someone living in a post-apocalyptical world.  I think this is someone who would be able to survive and fight in this kind of world.
2866,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Action; Adventure; Strategy; Trivia; Word,,"Choice D is not original. Don__ use it. I don__ like short hair, so B is out. I like the outfit in C. I think it fits the description"
2867,Male,$61-100k,Black,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Adventure; Action; Role Playing; Strategy; Simulation,,I like option C the best because I like that the character looks tough and gritty.  I also like they have a weapon and have body armor to protect their self.
2868,Male,$0-30k,White,High School,25-34,Trivia; Sports; Role Playing,,The character in C looks the toughest and most bad-ass of all the designs. That is who I would pick if I were playing. A isn't too bad but it is a little bit boring. I don't particularly like B or D. B is too revealing for my liking and I really don't like the Harley Quinn ripoff of D.
2869,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Strategy; Arcade; Puzzle; Trivia; Simulation,,I really like the make-shift armor design of C. It's a great blend of style and realism that makes for great world building in universes like Mad Max.
2870,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Strategy; Word,,"B is a little too skimpy and I think D is too risque, the others are a lot more realistic"
2871,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Adventure; Arcade; Puzzle; Role Playing; Strategy,,I think C is the best because she is dressed appropriately for the setting. I think women are classically underdressed in video games and that C is more realistic for a post apocolyptic world
2872,Male,$0-30k,Black,High School,21-24,Card; Strategy; Role Playing; Adventure; Action,,Option B is first because she looks sexy but also cool. Option C is second because this design fits the world the most but the design isn't as good as Option B for me. Option D looks too out of place for me but I'm not a fan of option A so that's why Option D is third. The main aspect that I was looking for was how well does the character fit in the world and how much I like the design.
2873,Male,$0-30k,Black,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Role Playing; Strategy,,"The character radiates stubbornness, toughness, and bad-assery. She seems like the type to defy authority and do whatever she wants."
2874,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,21-24,Action; Adventure; Sports; Trivia; Simulation,,"D is basically Harley Quinn - obnoxious, loud, and cheap. C ,B and A are identical ,essentially. THey have a good color scheme and look interesting"
2875,Male,$101k+,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Puzzle; Board; Card; Strategy; Trivia,,I ranked my choices based on which character appears to be best equipped to survive in a post-apocalyptic environment.
2876,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Word,,"I want a sexy character, of course, but also realistic, someone who looks like she could handle a fight. A gun and some cool armor is great. Or at least the leather spy outfit. Don't make her so cosmetically attractive that we don't believe her."
2877,Male,$31-60k,White,Associate Degree,25-34,Action; Music; Puzzle; Trivia,,It__ awesome you__e doing women! Option C is my favorite it__ like being on a deserted island. B too much skin for me and D too much Harley Quinn
2878,Male,$0-30k,White,Graduate Degree,25-34,Puzzle; Card; Board; Action,,"option A is the best with the short hair, lesbian kind of looking with a pistol only. Option C also looks decent enough  with the tatoos and and no weapon. Option D is the worse since she is just form suicide squad or something"
2879,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Trivia; Action; Adventure; Puzzle; Sports,,D is a copy so\ forget that one. C looks ready for battle. B and a are ok but they__e not as ready as c is
2880,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Role Playing; Educational; Strategy; Puzzle; Board,,My primary metric that I used was how attractive I found these characters. I like the dark hair and scant dress of B the most. I like the revealing coat and full lips of A the second most. The outfit is a bit campy in D but she is also attractive and is appropriately dressed for the Armageddon. C looks most like a standard soldier and isn't as attractive or revealing as the others.
2881,Male,$31-60k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Role Playing; Simulation; Arcade; Adventure; Action,,"Like the color choices and design of D as it sticks out more and reminds me of a rebellious survivor compared to the other options. The other options such as B and C  do remind me of a survivor, but D definitely just has a better overall aesthetic compared to them."
2882,Male,$31-60k,White,Graduate Degree,25-34,Trivia; Strategy; Simulation; Role Playing; Action,,"I like the cool armored look personally because to live in a world like that, I don't think you're gonna be walking around in a bikini."
2883,Male,$0-30k,Black,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Role Playing; Strategy; Word; Trivia; Action,,I absolutely love Harley Quinn but Option D is a complete rip off and obnoxious. I placed Option D last because of that. Options A and B are cool but Option B is showing a bit too much skin for this game. Option C looks to bulky in those clothes. I'm picture a Mad Max type of environment and she seems like she wouldn't die of a heat stroke if she wore those clothes.
2884,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Trivia; Puzzle; Educational; Board; Action,,Number 4 looks too much like an existing character. Number 3 is a little bit too unrealistic too.  Number one and number 2 are awesome I think number 1 is just a really good looking character too
2885,Male,$0-30k,White,High School,35-44,Adventure; Casino; Puzzle; Role Playing; Word,,"I really like the sleek looking girls, they look like they can move fast and have good survival skills"
2886,Male,$31-60k,White,Graduate Degree,25-34,Simulation; Sports; Strategy; Puzzle; Role Playing,,"Option C screams strong, powerful and survivor. I love her weapon and face pain. Her outfit tells a story (former military would be my guess) and I want to know more. I believe she can survive and I want to see her fight."
2887,Male,$31-60k,Other,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Board; Card; Role Playing; Simulation; Trivia,,"Honestly I like that B and A are women, but also that they have a ""normal"" bust size rather than massive boobs like every other game featuring women."
2888,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Card; Adventure; Action; Strategy; Role Playing,,B and A have cleavage. D is a Harley Quinn knockoff.
2889,Male,$0-30k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Adventure; Puzzle; Action; Strategy; Board,,"Option C looks way more realistic and practical. She looks like she is actually a survivor, making me interested in her story and invested in the character way more."
2890,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Adventure; Strategy; Role Playing,,"I don't like the Harley Quinn knockoff at all, ut all the others are good.  I prefer the two that have a bit more splash of color."
2891,Male,$31-60k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Strategy; Action; Adventure; Arcade; Role Playing,,"The Harley Quinn style design of my top choice is edgy and striking, which is appealing. Very cool design for sure!"
2892,Male,$0-30k,White,High School,25-34,,,The confidence and fit of both C and D are appealing to me with the look that is used for these characters here.
2893,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,"I ranked them by which seemed the most like an entertaining gangster from a movie.  I don't think most real-life gangsters are like this, however."
2894,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,"Flamboyance is fine but he still needs to fit in with this seedy underworld. Black, white and red will be your way to go. Gold in C is too flashy, B reminds me too much of Scarface and Option A just seems off."
2895,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,This guy fits the typical irish profile that I'd expect from this type of character.  That is why this guy is top in my mind
2896,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,"Option E does the best job at conveying arrogance. His outfit, and expression makes him draw in a natural, likely negative attention. hes a very appealing character overall."
2897,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,"These are all cool character designs - my favorite is E with the dark suit and open white shirt and gold watch, which is a very sophisticated gangster look."
2898,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,Went with the most flashy/sleazy first and went down in that order. Makes sense for a character such as this.
2899,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,I like option E the best because the design looks the most modern looking.
2900,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,"I like option C and D equally, as they are the most flamboyant and stylish looking clothes, in line with the description. Options B and E are  OK but look more like latin American gangster rather than caucasian - Irish. I do not like option A. Does not fit with the description, too casual."
2901,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,The character design in B and E are the most unique and non-generic. I like those the most
2902,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,"Based on the background story, Options D and E, in that order, are my favorite characters because the way they dress and their attitude and demeanor fits perfectly with this type of stylish but aggressive character."
2903,Male,$61-100k,Asian,Graduate Degree,25-34,,,I ranked the designs of the Brendan O'Callahan character that I liked the most.  I found the design of the character of option E to be the most appealing followed by the design of option B followed by option A then option D and then finally option C.
2904,Male,$31-60k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,"E is a perfect example of Irish high level gangster as we see in movies and our perception of it. Also, it fits with the background.B looks like a gangster but not elite. Expensive clothes but sense of styling is cheap.C looks good and might fit the Irish character. D gives an Irish vibe but looks like a vampire.A looks more like a Texas gangster."
2905,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,,,I like the outfits with the different color jackets from the pant.  It is bold and matches the description of the person. Your eye is drawn to the outfits as well since they are more colorful and they standout.
2906,Male,$31-60k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,I think option D fits the best because this looks like someone who can both hang out with the elites and mingle with the street gangs. He looks like someone well-dressed and flamboyant. Option C is good too. Option E can fit. Option B and A are okay fits.
2907,Male,$31-60k,Black,High School,25-34,,,"C and D look like he is an elite, someone that is used to luxury, so I went with that one."
2908,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,I really love A and C. They both have a modern but yet classic look that says he can fit well in both worlds.
2909,Male,$61-100k,Black,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,I like option A the best because I like the way he is dressed and the red color of his hair reminds me of the way someone with an Irish heritage would look like.
2910,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,,,"Option A was my far and away clear winner.  The others were all tied for last to me, only because A was the only one that fit the look of an Irish criminal.  The others either looked Italian or Cuban to me."
2911,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,,,chest busting out is the biggest flex a gangster could have so E and B are best
2912,Male,$0-30k,Hispanic,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,With the descriptions given to me I feel that D is the most fitting and also has the best design to it.
2913,Male,$31-60k,Hispanic,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,I like the open collar and neck tattoo look. Makes him look proper sleazy and interesting.
2914,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,"i think this order best describes him, i picture him a bit of a greaser, a cocky guy that isnt likeable when you look at him.  but in a sleezy way not a high end fashion sort of way"
2915,Male,$101k+,White,High School,25-34,,,"Based on the background option D fits the best. I like the style with the vest, the dark red color and the shoes/ring. It's the most flamboyant as well."
2916,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,25-34,,,I love option C the most because it is the most gang like in appearance as well as the most high end professional looking one.
2917,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,I ranked in order of how interesting I find the costumes. I particularly like jackets showing button shirts underneath.
2918,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,The image in the top choice fit the description very well
2919,Male,$31-60k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,"B was my favorite because I feel that the really low cut of the neck really shows the character's confidence and flashiness, especially since B has more flashy jewelry than the others."
2920,Male,$101k+,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,,,I ranked my choices based on which outfits seemed to fit the character the best and which outfits I liked the best. I prefer a more traditional look for the character.
2921,Male,$61-100k,Other,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,,,"C and D look more 'professional' and appropriate to someone higher up in a criminal organization and who enjoys designer clothes. B and E look too sloppy for someone who needs to get respect.  A is somewhere in the middle. Overall C is most aesthetically pleasing. Also note, clothes is spelled wrong in the description."
2922,Male,$0-30k,White,Graduate Degree,45-54,,,Option D looks most similar to the description.
2923,Male,$31-60k,White,Associate Degree,45-54,,,"They are all pretty stereo typical of the mob guy, not really that much creativity.  But B is the most appealing because it's subtle."
2924,Male,$0-30k,White,High School,25-34,,,Option D's clothing fits the description most. Option E is fine but isn't as flamboyant. Option D is the same as E but not as flamboyant as E. Option C makes him look like a cowboy and Option A just seems like a street thug.
2925,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,I just went with my gut feeling and chose the ones that stood out to me as fitting the theme the most
2926,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,I like e and b best.  The open button up showing off his chest is something that type of person would do.  I also like d and c as that also looks like something that type of person would do.  A is the only one that misses in my opinion
2927,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,25-34,,,I think that his outfit in option B is fancy and flashy enough to match his description.
2928,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,,,I chose panel B.  I really love the white jacket as this reminds me of gangsters and I love the look!
2929,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,,,I think that A looks to be a pretty good fit based on the description.
2930,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,E reminds me most of an italian gangster
2931,Male,$101k+,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,,,C seems like the most realistic and interesting character story.
2932,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,,,"This option looks more adequate, the description indicates that the character is flamboyant, and this suit is exactly that. His outfit evokes confidence and his face looks Irish. Option C is also flamboyant but less than my first choice, this face looks Irtish as well. Option A looks nice but the way he is dress doesn't show elegance and high class, is less formal. Option B is not as flamboyant as the previous options. Option E loos very elegant and high class but is not at all flamboyant."
2933,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,I think the names sounds like the guy is a dirt bag so I think the crappier the clothing the better.
2934,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,,,"Since this guy is middle man between the elites and the gangs, he needs to be smooth with lots of style.  That's how I made my choices."
2935,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,45-54,,,There is some touch of class on the outfit in option C. It has a lot of street representation too. Outfit in E is very classy with little street vibe.
2936,Male,$31-60k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,Option E looks a lot more badass and very related to the description
2937,Male,$0-30k,Black,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,"All of the choices fit the description. I just tried to pick the outfits that seemed to fit a douchebag gambler. Because it's a video game, I thought the character should still try to look cool. CBEAD ended up being my choices."
2938,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,"Option A is first because the character is wearing the most flamboyant clothes compared to the other four options, which is part of his character description. Option E is last because the clothes aren't really flamboyant."
2939,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,I prefer option B because it personifies Brendan's arrogant and flamboyant behavior. I also think that it is the most interesting and most visually appealing style out of the five options.
2940,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,25-34,,,Option C is first because the picture is appropriate for the gaming character.Option B is second because the picture is very suitable for the character.Option E is third because the character image is really great.Option D is fourth because the image is great for gaming character.Option A is fifth and also very likely for gaming.
2941,Male,$31-60k,White,Graduate Degree,45-54,,,"Option B's getup looks too Italian for an Irish gangsta! And Leo in Option A is sporting clothes that are too meh. But I like Options D, E, and C, and Option D is perfect for the well-dressed thug!"
2942,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,Daily,"Option E stands out the most. The color of the extra arms draw attention to them. I would imagine they would help the character with various tasks such as grabbing, or hanging onto things. Its a very unique look, with alot of possibilities."
2943,Female,$0-30k,Hispanic,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,Daily,THE OPTION I PICKED SEEMS TO GO WITH THE IMAGE THAT I THINK THEFUTURE WILL LOOK LIKE I THINK THE PURPOSE OF THE EQUIPMENT IS TO SCAN THEEARTH FOR ENERGY
2944,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,,Daily,"I think the ones with the robot arms are best, except the one that looks like it's made of junk (lawnmower).  Some of the others just seem a little plain."
2945,Male,$61-100k,Black,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,Daily,I like option G the best because I like how the robotic arms look and in all reality this is probably the most realistic scenario for 2030 because it's 2022 now and that's almost how some robots look now.
2946,Male,$31-60k,White,Graduate Degree,25-34,,Daily,"I think option B feels the most survival like and like it uses technology. I think this device stores, creates, and pulls energy that the user makes and from the air around the user."
2947,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,45-54,,Daily,"I picked B because In a future post apocalyptic world I imagine that the energy is going to simple, small and powerful.  B suits this the best.  D and F are close to it as well."
2948,Female,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,,Daily,"By that year I don't think equipment would be completely advanced so I chose some of the more basic equipment. I took into consideration where we are in real life and applied that to a ten year post apocalyptic time frame. I think the equipment should have some kind of basic ""hands"" that would allow it to grasp onto the alternative energy source, obviously in a safe manner because the equipment looks as though it would remain on the character during harvesting. In short, I don't think equipment would be too advanced but enough to be more advanced than Option D."
2949,Male,$31-60k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,Daily,G looks the best to me. I think the color of the equipment on the back has a more interesting color and it fits the scheme of the rest of the character.
2950,Female,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,Daily,I like the use of technology in the characters hand. I think the extra arms are used for inspecting and getting things done.
2951,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,Daily,We would definitely have robot arms in this time era it would not be an argument I do like the less aggressive robot  arms
2952,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,,Weekly,I like the mechanical looking arms
2953,Female,$61-100k,Hispanic,Graduate Degree,35-44,,Daily,"Definitely B, the equipment looks more technological and futuristic. I think this equipment is built to gather, rind and pick up materials that are dangerous but needed to a human survival and create energy for it"
2954,Male,$101k+,Hispanic,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,Daily,The battery pack looking device on the back makes it seem more relatable to energy like he's storing a sample
2955,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,,Daily,"I feel as if the equipment used in these images are to detect radiation, and to be able to safely handle contaminated items."
2956,Female,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,Daily,"I liked B the best because because it looks like a battery pack, or a proton pack of some kind on his back. It makes it looks like he is capturing sunlight or energy someone that way."
2957,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,Daily,I like the way the guy looks. I think the extra arms and the silver plating looks cool and it stands out a lot
2958,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,,Daily,"Seeing as how this is only supposed to be less than ten years into the future, the technology the character uses should be modern, but not too advanced. Any type of robotic arm use doesn't really fit which is why I like the approach of using the futuristic looking backpack."
2959,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,Daily,"2030 is only 8 years away, so I don't think the advancements in equipment and technology will be too dramatic.  I think D fits my impression of the era the best because he isn't overloaded with new equipment but there are clearly some more minor technological advances on him."
2960,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,Daily,"Options G and E, in that order, are my preferred choices because the equipment is imaginative and resourceful and would be most useful in working with new types of energy stored in the earth or produced in a lab setting."
2961,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,Weekly,"Eight years!?  That's nothing.  The person will look the most similar to what they look like today.  Eight years will not revolutionize their gear, especially if there was an apocolypse.  That would totally stop innovation."
2962,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,Daily,G looks the most badass.  The arms look the coolest and most dangerous at the same time.
2963,Male,$61-100k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,Daily,I liked choice B since the load out looks the most appealing and concise while being enclosed. Choice F looks too simple and basic. The purpose of the wuipment looks like to harness energy forms.
2964,Female,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,Weekly,I like B the most.  I think it fits this idea.
2965,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,Daily,I don't care for the extra arms.  They don't seem like they would be fun to play with and don't interest me.
2966,Male,$0-30k,Black,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,Daily,"2030 being no so far away, I would imagine this type of technology would look ""Prototype-ish"" and would not look as polished as some of these technological advances look. Option C and B look the most achievable in that time and  fits my imagination. This is what I see first when I think of the prompt."
2967,Female,$31-60k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,,Weekly,"Firstly, I love that the character featured is a person of color. Especially in their depiction of being smart and resourceful-great representation! I like Option F most as it contains some identifiable components to me (i.e. metal detector). I could see that metal detector device being helpful to find more pherris materials for other purposes."
2968,Female,$61-100k,Black,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,Weekly,I selected Option C because I think our robotics will be advanced to this stage in 8 years times. It seems to be a good fit. Makes me think of Octoman.
2969,Female,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,Daily,"I think Option A fits this concept. I think the character would have a lot to carry on his back, but it would be kind of compact. I think these extra hands look really useful."
2970,Male,$0-30k,White,High School,25-34,,Weekly,"D, I find this character looks the most basic while also carrying cases and tools that would fit with the time most likely. F, this character looks very interesting using tools that have been modified for a new purpose, this looks very interesting.B, this character looks like they carry something in their backpack, and it might have liquid in it, as well as they are carrying a toolbox.E, this character has the robotic arms that look fairly simple in use as they aren't holding any weapons or tools and is probably the most accurate for the time.A, I like that this character has tools, however I dislike the robotic arm with the grinder, it would be very dangerous.G, this looks fairly dangerous with potentially high voltage robotic arms and it looks like it would be very heavy.C, I really dislike this, the robotic arms look very strange with long fingers, and holding a weapon, especially a gun would probably be very dangerous, especially to the character that doesn't have any ear protection."
2971,Female,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,Daily,"I prefer option  B for this description of era and character, purpose, I think that this is the only device that seems to be able to ""gather"" energy and harvest it, store it."
2972,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,Weekly,"I honestly think that all fit this concept quite well, but I like G B and C the most. I assume that the gear that all of them have had to do with how polluted the world is then. I think it helps them navigate how dangerous the world is in the future."
2973,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,Daily,"A, C, E and G all seem to fit what I think 2030 would be like with exoskeletons being able to help us do task and lift things for us."
2974,Female,$61-100k,Hispanic,Graduate Degree,35-44,,Daily,To find out sources of viable life that can help humanity.
2975,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,,Rarely,I don__ like the ones with the arms. I don__ feel like you could extract an energy would with them. I prefer the big pack in choice B. I feel like it would have room to store the extracted energy. It fits the description best for me. The ones with the arms look like they__ be better for other purposes
2976,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,Monthly,I prioritized the images based on what seems more feasible for a human to be holding/operating at one time. The equipment is almost like a Geiger counter and laser driller
2977,Male,$31-60k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,,Rarely,"The yellow arms in my top choice are bold and confident, which fits the theme of clean energy for sure!"
2978,Male,$101k+,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,,Monthly,I am not crazy about the bionic arms as they dont look to be functional so I like the versions that looked to be the most functional.  I also think these are there to help the character do a specific job like repairing something.
2979,Male,$0-30k,Black,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,Daily,I picked D because all of the other options look heavy.
2980,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,Daily,"I like option G as he looks a little more realistic. I think the equipment is for picking up, probing, and analyzing different items on the ground or around to make sure they are safe to handle."
2981,Male,$101k+,Asian,Graduate Degree,35-44,,Weekly,"I liked the external components and peripherals of the exo suit on Choices F & C the most since they depicted what I envisioned as useful for workers seeking these sources of energy. While I thought the remaining items on the other character depictions were acceptable, I thought they were not as relatable to what a worker would need to extract energy."
2982,Female,$31-60k,White,Associate Degree,35-44,,Daily,I imagine the long arms are for picking up items that the character finds along their journey
2983,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,Daily,The extra arms are really cool and can go In so many different directions with the character.
2984,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,Daily,I like E because it is futuristic looking but also realistic and believable.
2985,Female,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,Rarely,"i would imagine we wouldnt need to carry too many things around so i went for the lightest, most technology-heavy one i could see"
2986,Male,$101k+,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,,Daily,I really like my first choice since I have a metal dector myself and like that it is being used.  But they all are very good and I think you could not go wrong with any of them.
2987,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,Daily,I liked e the best.  Really fits the scenario.  I feel that the extra appendages will help with collecting samples and operating equipment.
2988,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,,Weekly,"The picture was a little bigger for me to see and it stood out more, plus the gadgets were what I think we could expect in the next 10 years."
2989,Female,$61-100k,Hispanic,Graduate Degree,35-44,,Rarely,At about the choices I would prefer the images with the robotic arms or the robotic tool that is connected on the backpack. I would think of this type of world he would be the most useful to me and preventing myself from getting hurt
2990,Male,$101k+,White,Graduate Degree,45-54,,Daily,I put in order by how much each pack fit the character - B is best then G E A C F and D
2991,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,35-44,,Daily,I think they would use wind energy and geothermal .
2992,Male,$0-30k,Other,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Role Playing; Puzzle,Weekly,B shows the best looking world. And I like the poses of all the characters. C is fine. Has a movie poster look to it. C is the most boring being a desert.
2993,Female,$0-30k,Asian,Graduate Degree,25-34,Action; Adventure; Sports; Simulation; Role Playing,Daily,"The colors in A were too light; they felt a bit sterile. I loved the bold, energetic red colors in B."
2994,Male,$61-100k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Role Playing; Educational; Casino; Adventure; Action,Daily,C has the best theme and drawing personality with the girls and weapons of choice. A would be next its characters. B would be my last choice.
2995,Female,$0-30k,White,Less than High School Diploma,35-44,Strategy; Action; Role Playing; Simulation,Daily,The characters appear more bonded here. It shows the backdrop. It tells me that it is an apocalyptic game.
2996,Male,$0-30k,Asian,Associate Degree,25-34,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Role Playing; Simulation,Daily,I like Option C the best because you get a good view of the varied characters. In Option A the characters look too generic.
2997,Male,$0-30k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Role Playing; Strategy,Daily,Options C and B showcase female lead characters and creates more empowerment.
2998,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Adventure; Strategy; Role Playing,Daily,"I like the one that shows the world more than just character close-ups.  The characters are ok, but nothing special by themselves."
2999,Male,$61-100k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Strategy; Role Playing,Daily,I liked choice C the best since the team is concentrated on the center of the image and they look strong and confident. Choice B is too distracting since the team is too spread out and is hard to focus on.
3000,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Role Playing; Adventure; Puzzle,Daily,I made my choice based on which best shows the characters invoved and also the envrionment that would be played in.
3001,Male,$31-60k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Arcade; Role Playing; Sports,Daily,"B is a little more intriguing to me. I think this has a more modern and clear looking art style and I find that appealing, it looks more futuristic."
3002,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Strategy; Role Playing; Simulation; Action; Adventure,Weekly,The woman featured looks very powerful.  It is her build and her posture that give that impression
3003,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Adventure; Role Playing; Strategy,Daily,I think c is the most ready for gameplay.  Looks like what the characters will look like during the game.
3004,Female,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Role Playing; Word; Strategy; Simulation; Action,Daily,I ranked based on which shot was the most attention grabbing and appealing to me personally.

3006,Male,$31-60k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Strategy; Action; Adventure; Arcade; Role Playing,Rarely,"The green haired character in my top choice is fresh and vibrant, which is appealing. Honestly all three options are very cool for sure!"
3007,Male,$0-30k,White,High School,35-44,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Role Playing; Puzzle,Daily,"The mecha style robot in the background looks interesting, assuming it is part of the game. Apart from that, my second choice feels like a more diverse cast which would be more interesting for gameplay."
3008,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Action; Adventure; Card; Puzzle; Role Playing,Daily,"Option B is the most appealing image because you can see a lot of the environment behind the characters and the characters themselves are a huge splash of color in the foreground. The red outfit and the blonde and pink hair styles certainly grab my attention the most. It also doesn't shove all of the characters into a tight group formation and allows your eyes to wander around the picture more. Options C and A are good as well, but nowhere near as exciting or attention-grabbing as Option B."
3009,Female,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Action; Adventure; Puzzle; Role Playing; Strategy,Daily,A is the most engaging image at first glance
3010,Male,$31-60k,Black,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Puzzle; Strategy; Role Playing; Adventure; Action,Daily,Options C and A look like great JRPG's/Action games and the character designs help make these options interesting.
3011,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,21-24,Strategy; Simulation; Role Playing; Casino; Adventure,Monthly,"Option B by far is my favorite and I like the style extremely compared to the cartoonish designs of the others. C & A are what I would consider tradition backgrounds but B was novel and attention grabbing. Even if I didn__ play the game, I would use B as a desktop background."

""C"" and ""A"" and about equal in badass-ness, but don't intrigue me as much as ""B""."
3015,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Adventure; Puzzle; Role Playing; Strategy,Daily,"I chose option C because I like how all of the characters are standing together.

3016,Male,$61-100k,Black,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Adventure; Action; Role Playing; Strategy; Simulation,Daily,I like option B the best because the image provides me with small details that makes me thing the game would offer up some interesting game play based off of some of the sci-fi/futuristic things I see in the image.
3017,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Sports; Adventure; Strategy; Role Playing,Daily,"C looks the most appealing as I like the tough looking characters in a post apocalyptic setting. B is similar, but I am not such a fan of showing character's behinds and the art looks very rough. B is my bottom choice because it looks excessively generic."
3018,Male,$0-30k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Action; Adventure; Role Playing; Strategy; Educational,Daily,I like the game picture in option A the best. I like the way the characters are displayed against the background especially the two larger male characters.
3019,Male,$101k+,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Action; Casino; Role Playing; Sports; Racing,Daily,I am a huge fan of dark black and dark red together like you have in my choice one.  Really attracts me to the game and wanting more infomration.  The other ones seem to cloudy or not as clear.
3020,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,25-34,Card; Role Playing; Simulation; Music; Strategy,Weekly,I think Option C has the best character design.

3022,Male,$101k+,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Adventure; Action; Strategy; Role Playing; Simulation,Daily,I like how C and A make it look like the characters are banded together.
3023,Female,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Action; Puzzle; Strategy; Role Playing; Trivia,Daily,Option B shows the world in which these characters reside. The colors red and blue really stand out in this picture. It's eye-catching. A is also colorful. C is bland and looks generic.

3025,Female,$31-60k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Arcade; Puzzle; Role Playing; Trivia; Word,Daily,"I chose based on character, style and overall possible game play"
3026,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Adventure; Strategy; Casino; Role Playing; Trivia,Daily,"To start, my bottom choice was easy as it looks fairly generic and does not really stand out. I really liked my top choice as it feels futuristic and the characters look very cool. The middle choice also looked cool, but the weapons looked a bit dull."
3027,Male,$61-100k,Hispanic,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Strategy; Sports; Action; Role Playing; Racing,Daily,Its this one just because I like that the characters have weapons and are ready to fight. I also like the style of characters. So the combination of both make it the best to me.
3028,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,35-44,Casino; Adventure; Arcade; Action; Role Playing,Daily,"I think the larger character pictures really show the characters off better, plus the different colors reflect their different personalities."
3029,Male,$0-30k,White,High School,35-44,Board; Adventure; Role Playing; Strategy; Simulation,Monthly,"I chose B and C first because I liked what was going on in the background with the city in ruins. I chose A last because it seemed a bit boring, just the characters with white in the background."
3030,Male,$31-60k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Action; Adventure; Role Playing; Simulation; Strategy,Weekly,Looks to be the most unique/original out of them all. Future and fantasy mixed in one.
3031,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Sports; Role Playing; Puzzle,Daily,The zoomed-in characters meshing with the others in-game is the most creative and innovative way to look at this.
3032,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Racing; Role Playing; Sports; Trivia,Daily,B has the best graphics and most clear
3033,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Role Playing; Strategy,Daily,I chose option C first because I like how close together these characters feel and look in this landscape picture. I chose option B second because I like the black and red outfit this character is wearing and the background image in this image. I chose option A last because I do not like the style of this image compared to the other images.
3034,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Adventure; Casino; Strategy; Action; Role Playing,Daily,I find this one to be most appealing. I find I resonate with it more. It's more interesting and enticing
3035,Male,$31-60k,White,Graduate Degree,25-34,Simulation; Sports; Strategy; Puzzle; Role Playing,Daily,I like option B because there appears to be a lot going on and it is beautiful. There is a story there and the image makes me curious to know more.
3036,Female,$101k+,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Action; Adventure; Casino; Role Playing,Daily,Option B is the most visually appealing and grabs your attention more right off the bat.  The images and characters are crisper and you get a better visual of what they look like and would be like to use in the game.  They also have a more modern and unique look to them which makes you form a higher first impression that the game is fun and exciting.  They also look more realistic and give you a sense the game is more advanced and would be more visually stimulating to play.  Option B would appeal to a wider audience of people and would make them more interested in learning more about what the game has to offer.
3037,Male,$101k+,Asian,Graduate Degree,35-44,Action; Strategy; Simulation; Role Playing; Family,Weekly,"I liked A the most because it depicted teamwork to me in the artwork, I thought C was ok because it showed the characters working together while I was unclear with what choice B was depicting which is why I liked it the least."
3038,Male,$31-60k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Role Playing; Strategy,Daily,I like the artwork in option A because it looks the most novel and unique to me. Option B and C don't feel quite as memorable to me.
3039,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Board; Simulation; Strategy; Puzzle; Role Playing,Daily,The colors used in the title screen help it stand out and look unique
3040,Female,$31-60k,White,Associate Degree,25-34,Action; Board; Puzzle; Role Playing; Sports,Daily,"As a female gamer, seeing another female in the game, especially one that looks like such a bad a** in option B makes me super excited and happy, so I would 100 percent buy option B because of how awesome the girl character looks, and the colors, just super cool."
3041,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Arcade; Strategy; Trivia; Role Playing; Simulation,Daily,Option C is first because the weapons that they're holding are very eye-catching and makes it seem fun and action-filled. Option A is last because the close up images of the characters at the top is too much.
3042,Male,$0-30k,Other,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Role Playing; Puzzle,Weekly,The worlds in B and A seems the most interesting. Like the poses in B a lot. A is fine. C is a desert which seems the most boring to me.
3043,Female,$0-30k,Asian,Graduate Degree,25-34,Action; Adventure; Sports; Simulation; Role Playing,Daily,I thought the body language in A looked a bit wishy washy. I thought B's character looked bolder and thought the colors in C were the most daring.
3044,Male,$61-100k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Role Playing; Educational; Casino; Adventure; Action,Daily,The art style and design of option C is amazing and draws me closer to the game. I love the post apoctalyptic feel to it. A would be next in line due to its bright setting . B is great as well but not as good as C and A
3045,Female,$31-60k,Black,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Role Playing; Simulation; Action,Weekly,"I understand this photo that i have ranked as number one because the painting is not complex,the one i ranked last is too complicated"
3046,Female,$0-30k,White,Less than High School Diploma,35-44,Strategy; Action; Role Playing; Simulation,Daily,This one shows the backdrop. I get the impression that it is an apocalyptic game.
3047,Male,$0-30k,Asian,Associate Degree,25-34,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Role Playing; Simulation,Daily,I like the variation of body types in Options C and B. The characters in Option A look too generic.
3048,Male,$0-30k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Role Playing; Strategy,Daily,"Option C looks more rag tag, relatable to average person. Not too prestigious."
3049,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Adventure; Strategy; Role Playing,Daily,"Well definitely not the one that's just girls in dresses.  The team close-up isn't very interesting either, but the one that shows the city and a robot and other stuff seems the best."
3050,Male,$61-100k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Strategy; Role Playing,Daily,I liked choice A the best since the squad looks confident and strong while not being too close together or too far apart. Choice B is too distracting since the team is so spread out and it makes it hard to focus on them.
3051,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,35-44,Action; Adventure; Role Playing; Simulation; Strategy,Daily,"B looks interesting like after a cataclysm or in the future or something , I like it a lot and it makes me curious what the world is like , C looks like it is more war related which can be good if done right, A looks like every other fantasy game out and does not grab my attention at all"
3052,Male,$0-30k,White,Less than High School Diploma,35-44,Card; Role Playing; Adventure; Strategy; Arcade,Monthly,"I think C has a darker,more gritty feel then the others."
3053,Male,$31-60k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Arcade; Role Playing; Sports,Daily,B and C are the ones I like the most. I prefer B a bit more because it looks more distinctive and the environment looks more intriguing to me.
3054,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Adventure; Role Playing; Strategy,Daily,I think b has the cleanest look and the characters look ready for combat.
3055,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Strategy; Role Playing; Simulation; Action; Adventure,Weekly,This woman looks very powerful.  It is her muscular build and posture that gives off that vibe
3056,Female,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Role Playing; Word; Strategy; Simulation; Action,Daily,"I ranked based on my own personal choice, and which picture would grab my attention the fastest if I were scrolling through a platform like the app store."
3057,Male,$31-60k,Black,High School,25-34,Action; Music; Role Playing; Simulation; Sports,Weekly,I like B the most because it presents the characters in a cinematic light. C the least because I can't tell the setting.
3058,Male,$31-60k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Strategy; Action; Adventure; Arcade; Role Playing,Rarely,"I like the green-haired character in my top choice, which is fun and vibrant. Overall all three options are very cool for sure!"
3059,Male,$0-30k,White,High School,35-44,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Role Playing; Puzzle,Daily,My bottom choice feels like it could be any of several dozen anime style games. Just not that interesting. The more varied cast in my second and top choices out step it. The robot in the background of my top pick is the most interesting to me as it hints more to the style of game and not just an anime graphic style.
3060,Female,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Action; Adventure; Puzzle; Role Playing; Strategy,Daily,B looks the most unique and interesting of the three
3061,Male,$31-60k,Black,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Puzzle; Strategy; Role Playing; Adventure; Action,Daily,Options C and A look like great JRPG's/Action games and the character designs help make these options interesting.
3062,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,21-24,Strategy; Simulation; Role Playing; Casino; Adventure,Monthly,B is the most artistically styled one and it would be something I use outside of playing the game such as for a desktop background. The other two feel like traditional anime backgrounds and didn__ hold my attention as well as the first.
3063,Female,$31-60k,White,High School,25-34,Role Playing; Strategy; Action; Adventure; Arcade,Daily,I went with what was the most appealing to me.

3065,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Arcade; Role Playing; Simulation; Strategy,Weekly,"""B"" looks the most intriguing, big, and engrossing.  ""C"" looks the most badass/  ""A"" is pretty much just a standard JRPG image."
3066,Male,$61-100k,Black,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Adventure; Action; Role Playing; Strategy; Simulation,Daily,"I like option B the best because I like that the characters are dressed in a style that would be more realistic style and I like that I can see the tiny little girl that is standing on the floating robot machine, that makes me think that this game would be really interesting to play for the futuristic elements it would provide."
3067,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Adventure; Puzzle; Role Playing; Strategy,Daily,I chose option C because I like how all of the characters are grouped together.  I also really like the weapons shown in this picture which would want to make me try out this game.
3068,Male,$0-30k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Action; Adventure; Role Playing; Strategy; Educational,Daily,I find the image in option A to be the most appealing. The characters create an appealing contrast with the background. I like how the game name is positioned on the top left side.
3069,Female,$31-60k,White,Associate Degree,35-44,Adventure; Family; Music; Role Playing; Simulation,Daily,I like seeing the city in the background as it makes me imagine the area the characters can potentially explore
3070,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Sports; Adventure; Strategy; Role Playing,Daily,"C has a post apocalyptic setting I like with tougher characters and a nice art style. A looks generic, but the art is at least nice and the magic aspect looks intriguing. B lacks personality and I do not appreciate that the buttocks seem to be the highlight of the image."
3071,Male,$101k+,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Action; Casino; Role Playing; Sports; Racing,Daily,The first two are great.  Like the colors in those.  It really makes the characters stand out.  The last one is to cloudy or muted to me.  Does not have the same affect as B and A.
3072,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,25-34,Card; Role Playing; Simulation; Music; Strategy,Weekly,I think Option C has the best character design overall.

3076,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Adventure; Strategy; Casino; Role Playing; Trivia,Daily,"My top choice was very easy as the characters look unique and the design looks like its very high quality. The middle choice was tough, but I liked how the background pops. My bottom choices looks a little more dull and doesn't really look unique."
3077,Male,$61-100k,Hispanic,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Strategy; Sports; Action; Role Playing; Racing,Daily,I feel like the characters look like they are ready for battle here. I like the fact that they have weapons and seem to be ready for war.
3078,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,35-44,Casino; Adventure; Arcade; Action; Role Playing,Daily,"I prefer the brighter artwork and the focus on each character individually, it really makes each one stand out."
3079,Female,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Role Playing; Adventure; Strategy; Puzzle,Daily,"I chose A first because it looks like they have magical weapons and I prefer magic over shooter games. I also like the costumes the best in option A. Option B looks like it is still set in a fantasy setting, so I chose it second. Option C looks like it is a post-apocalyptical shooter game with cute characters, which is fine, but it is not my cup of tea. If I am playing a fantasy game, I want it to be fun and full of magic, not guns and violence."
3080,Male,$31-60k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Action; Adventure; Role Playing; Simulation; Strategy,Weekly,Cool cyberpunk/tech style graphic. It kind of has a look of future and past mixed together.
3081,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Sports; Role Playing; Puzzle,Daily,The characters look like they are fighting together and the weapons are the most creative.
3082,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Racing; Role Playing; Sports; Trivia,Daily,The resolution is the best on b
3083,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Role Playing; Strategy,Daily,I chose option C first because I like how close together these characters feel and look in this landscape picture. I chose option B second because I like the black and red outfit this character is wearing and the background image in this image. I chose option A last because I do not like the style of this image compared to the other images.
3084,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Adventure; Casino; Strategy; Action; Role Playing,Daily,I find this one most appealing. It's more intriguing and relatable
3085,Male,$0-30k,Black,Associate Degree,35-44,Arcade; Simulation; Board; Role Playing; Strategy,Daily,C looks gritty and I like that. B looks like a mix of sci-fi and fantasy. A looks interesting
3086,Male,$31-60k,White,Graduate Degree,25-34,Simulation; Sports; Strategy; Puzzle; Role Playing,Daily,I love all of the action in option B. There's so much to look at and that makes me the most curious about the game.
3087,Male,$101k+,Asian,Graduate Degree,35-44,Action; Strategy; Simulation; Role Playing; Family,Weekly,I liked option A the most because it gave more of a cooperative play depiction versus choice B. I was neutral towards choice C because I liked the grouping of characters but didn't like the darker colors used.
3088,Male,$0-30k,Black,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Action; Adventure; Role Playing; Word,Weekly,The last one looks most boring because anime girls with big guns is overdone to me. The robot aesthetic is newer and looks more appealing to me.
3089,Female,$101k+,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Action; Adventure; Casino; Role Playing,Daily,Option B is clearer and has a more modern and exciting look to it.  That characters stand out more and you get a stronger sense that the game would be visually appealing and easy to use and see what you are doing.  The characters seem to match up better with the idea and theme of the game and would be a better fit for the user.  They also feel more fun and vibrant and seem to make you feel like the game would match those ideals as well.  Option B would appeal to more people and would make them more likely to check deeper into what it has to offer.
3090,Male,$31-60k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Role Playing; Strategy,Daily,I prefer option C because it looks the most intriguing and colorful to me. Option B and A feel rather just average to me!
3091,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Arcade; Strategy; Trivia; Role Playing; Simulation,Daily,"The weapons that they're holding in Option C makes it the best looking one. Option B is next over Option A because of the background, which makes it look epic."
3092,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Racing; Arcade; Board; Adventure; Action,,She has the most unique interesting and well-detailed look to her with great weapons and I love the car as it has a huge amount of character and makes it incredibly interesting for me. It isn't like anything I have seem before and I love it for its overall uniqueness.
3093,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Card; Adventure; Action; Strategy; Role Playing,,"i really like all these designs my only issue is that since this is post nuclear all of these paint jobs are extremely colorful vibrant and just outlandish. i like the cartoony approach it looks neat, but i think there is a way better direction you can take here."
3094,Male,$31-60k,Asian,Graduate Degree,25-34,Adventure; Casino; Puzzle; Strategy; Role Playing,,I like the avatar that was used in E that is why i ranked it the best.  I liked the avatar the least that was used in D.
3095,Male,$0-30k,Other,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Role Playing; Puzzle,,A and B sell the cars which should be the focus. Shows off the weapons and cool designs. The rest focuses on the player characters. E looks really cool and fits in the world. C is eh. D doesn't feel like it would fit in as well in this kind of game.
3096,Male,$0-30k,Hispanic,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Action; Strategy; Simulation; Sports; Casino,,the designs  look really cool the pink not so much maybe a darker color like black
3097,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Adventure; Card; Educational; Casino; Music,,"I like the choice of clothing and design of the vehicle, which look very futuristic."
3098,Male,$0-30k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Action; Adventure; Role Playing; Simulation; Card,,"In terms of concept arts for a post-apocalyptic racing game, I think Option C, D, and E are all suitable because they give a good sense of character concept/progression and vehicle design for the racing."
3099,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Arcade; Strategy; Trivia; Role Playing; Simulation,,"Option B is ranked last because, while it may have cool colors, it's the most plain. I love Option E the most because of the design of the character and the vehicle, as they're both eye-catching and makes it seem very exciting to me."
3100,Male,$61-100k,Black,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Adventure; Racing; Strategy; Action; Simulation,,I liked Option C the most out of the five choices. I can see the car fully and I like it's design. I also like the way the driver looks. She and the car compliment each other. She just seems like that type of character that would drive the care (if that makes sense). Overall the design is appealing and makes me curious about the abilities of the car.
3101,Male,$31-60k,Other,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Board; Card; Role Playing; Simulation; Trivia,,"I love the chainsaws on the front of A, the girl in E and the spikes on the tires in B"
3102,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,25-34,Simulation; Action; Adventure; Role Playing; Strategy,,I really do not like the concept art for options C and D. The characters look very flat and kind of not well fleshed out. I also don't like the car in design E C and D compared to the chainsaw pink car. The Car in options B and A both tell me that they've got weapons and conveys the message that was typed above.
3103,Male,$0-30k,Hispanic,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Sports; Adventure; Action,,I feel that the design choice is pretty unique and I feel does a good job to stand out on its own. E does the best job to have a character design mesh well with the type of vehicle that is driven.
3104,Male,$61-100k,Hispanic,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Adventure; Puzzle; Action; Strategy; Arcade,,"E reminds me a lot of tank girl and i like that , well done"
3105,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Puzzle; Strategy,,"I really liked the car designs, especially for options B and A. However, I think the characters could be a little bit cooler."
3106,Male,$31-60k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Arcade; Role Playing; Sports,,"A looks the best to me. I like the way this art style is polished and smooth, it looks fairly realistic and detailed."
3107,Male,$31-60k,Asian,High School,18-20,Adventure; Simulation; Action,,"Option D has the coolest character who is also pretty attractive and interesting. Option E's character also has a lot of cool appeal as well. Option C is less so but, but still badass. And option A and B are just normal shots of the car, not too exciting."
3108,Male,$61-100k,Other,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Strategy; Simulation; Role Playing; Puzzle; Educational,,"The characters are too cartoony so the ones featuring them got placed in last with the two not featuring them getting placed first, A>B. The ones with the characters, D>E>C, were placed in such position because I think D's character fits with their car. E is really cool it reminds me of Junkrat from overwatch or maybe harley quinn. I like the idea of editing cars in such a circumstance. The first two photos are good and what you think of when you think of this scenario, i.e. mad max"
3109,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Arcade; Card; Educational; Puzzle; Music,,I like the more punk style of the spikes and such on the cars it looks quite nice overall
3110,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Arcade; Role Playing; Trivia; Puzzle,,"E, C, and D all ranked about the same for me. I like that they show me the car with weapons and stuff along with the character. Although, when I think of post apocalypse I dont think bright neo tokyo style clothing"
3111,Male,$0-30k,Asian,Associate Degree,25-34,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Role Playing; Simulation,,I prefer the concept art that show both the character and the car. I like the twin-tail hair design on Option E. I feel the character in Option C is too old-looking.
3112,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Adventure; Board; Puzzle; Role Playing; Strategy,,"The first image looks the grittiest and rebellious in a very post apocalyptic way, love the spikes. The second image like the first has a nice post apocalyptic design, don't like the bright colours of the vehicle being too shiny. The third one has a good shading a minimal survivor design, very basic, but everything is there with the mismatched clothing and 80's look. The fourth one has a good all encompassing style, but the proportions of decoration are a bit too much, kind of pulls away from the art style. The fifth one, while it does look nice, does not look as nice or as rebellious as the others, seems almost like the protagonist of the game, but bland and uninteresting."
3113,Male,$101k+,White,Vocational Training,25-34,Arcade; Card; Strategy; Puzzle; Word,,I greatly prefer the art without the people in it because you can see the car and the personality it has better. Also they look pretty dope while the car featured in the other 3 (E/D/C) is meh
3114,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Strategy; Puzzle; Adventure,,I like option B the best because it seems much more rugged and practical. I think it would be able to handle more things in an uncertain world and landscape.
3115,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Arcade; Word,,I really like the chainsaws on the front of the car in A. I think they look cool. I like the focus of the car in A and B. I like the look of the driver in C. E and D are okay.
3116,Male,$0-30k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Adventure; Puzzle; Action; Strategy; Board,,"I'd assume based on the description, for a lot of off-roading in an apocalypse setting, you'd want a higher lift on your car to avoid rocks and other obstacles, and Option B fits that perfectly."
3117,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Board; Simulation; Strategy; Puzzle; Role Playing,,C E and D are much cleaner looking images that give me a good look at the car
3118,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Sports,,"Choices A and B are the two concept arts that I liked the most because I liked how they both were vehicle in the environment focused shots. Since vehicles and vehicle combat seem to be a big focus of the game from the description, I felt like it was important for the art to solely focus on the vehicle aspect. Choice A was first for me because I like the clean contrast between the bright pink color the car has to it and the sandy desert backdrop it is driving through with the sand dust the vehicle is blowing up. I like the sleek and sheen style and look this car has to it a lot. I also like the double chainsaws that are ion the front as that was really cool and unique to me. Choice B is second because while I like how the background has more of a racecourse element to it the car did not pop as much to it as it was a more muted color. It has more of an anarchy element to it with the dull paint, simple graffiti style and the spikes. I did like the top row of lights on it. Choice E was third because it is the character and car concept art that I liked the best. I liked the look of the female character the best with the google and jacket contrasting with how the rest of her outfit looked. Choice C was fourth for me because I liked how the character here was also holding a gun like Choice E as that is the weapon I would expect. I like the undershirt that she is wearing under her jacket a lot. I was not really big on the two different colors tights that she is wearing though. It is too funky for me. Choice D is last because I did not like that she is holding a wheel as opposed to a weapon and the camera looking thing did not fit with the setting either to me. Her outfit look was okay. As for the car since Choices E, C and D all have the same one it is solid. I like the color and the machine gun on top of it. It seems like the type of car that would be built more for speed then power in this game."
3119,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Sports; Adventure; Strategy; Role Playing,,"I think all the designs look awful and resemble a cheap 1990s early 3D cartoon. B is my top choice because it looks the most fierce and ridiculous to drive around in a game given the scenery implied. E is similar, but the chainsaws seem less practical than guns. C , D, and E are all equally bad for me. I do not mind the car in each, but the characters all look like rejected pimps in the apocalypse given the shoes and absurd clothes. E is my least favorite character as I prefer fully clothed options and the character looks like a bad Harley Quinn ripoff."
3120,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,35-44,Adventure; Simulation; Strategy; Trivia; Role Playing,,"i like the see the vehicle as it is in A, in action, I also like the pink color"
3121,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Strategy; Arcade; Puzzle; Trivia; Simulation,,The apocalyptic versions that look similar to Mad Max is what I'd like to play with.
3122,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Card; Role Playing; Adventure,,I like E because of the characters makeup. I like D because of the persons pose. I like C because of the gun held out. I like A for the chainsaws shown. I like B because of all the spikes.
3123,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,35-44,Casino; Adventure; Arcade; Action; Role Playing,,"My top pick looks the best by far, and like it would survive driving around in this new post apocalyptic environment, especially lifted, like it can offroad the best."
3124,Male,$0-30k,Black,High School,21-24,Trivia; Puzzle; Strategy; Arcade; Action,,I prefer option E's hand-drawn artstyle and character design. Option A's vehicle shows off the combat aspect very well through its weapons and has a more inspired design than option B.
3125,Male,$0-30k,White,High School,25-34,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Music; Puzzle,,"I picked B, E and D as my top choices as I love the bold design and colors on the characters."
3126,Male,$0-30k,Black,High School,25-34,Action; Role Playing; Simulation; Sports; Word,,I like the designs
3127,Male,$0-30k,White,High School,35-44,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Role Playing; Puzzle,,"To me, the theme needs a very lived in feel. A and B the cars look too new. While they would take care of them, obviously, they are too pristine even with heavy mods. Which leaves character design on A, B, and E. Once again, I went with a lived in, used up feel of torn clothes and honestly a bit dirty."
3128,Male,$61-100k,Asian,Graduate Degree,25-34,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Racing; Sports,,I ranked the designs of the postnuclear apocalypse world racing game that I liked the most.  I liked the way the driver looked in option E the most followed by the image of option C followed by option D then option B and then finally option A.
3129,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Puzzle; Strategy; Role Playing,,"E is the best character and most clear. C also has good character design. B is a good car and is clear, but not as dynamic as the character portraits. D has a character that's too hard to read, the big block of color around the shoulders gets hard to see detail. Option A looks too generic."
3130,Male,$101k+,Asian,Graduate Degree,35-44,Adventure; Strategy,,Choice B is my favorite because the ride looks bad ass and feels like it could both do damage and sustain damage. I like choice E because it looks like it has ramming power but I really like the look of the character that reminds me of harley quinn. I like the car in choice A but it feels a bit too polished and in mint condition to be realistic. Choices D and C are both okay but prefer the character from choice E best.
3131,Male,$0-30k,White,High School,25-34,Simulation; Sports,,"I would rank D first because it has an interesting character in front of the vehicle with an attention drawing bright blue jacket and a sassy attitude that is appealing. E and C would follow as they too have characters but the red jacket is less attention catching then the bright blue one and the green costume is even less appealing. A and B would be last as they don't have a character in front of the cars, and I would rank them with A above B because A as a car is less clunky and sleeker and also more interesting with chainsaws at the front and is in motion, making it more impressive than B."
3132,Male,$31-60k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Role Playing; Strategy,,I prefer option C because it seems the most fun and exciting. Option A and B seem very thrilling too. Option D and E leave a lot to be desired to me.
3133,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Adventure; Strategy; Role Playing; Simulation,,"E, C and D look like the best car. I love the red and how fast it looks. A and B look to kiddish for me."
3134,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,35-44,Board; Card; Word,,"I think D and E are the stronger of the character arts, and I like the action shot of A a lot, that angle is great and shows off all the weaponry and such. I would like to see more of the weapons, as it feels like that's the real draw of the game, but it has a cool kind of Borderlands feel to it!"
3135,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Strategy; Music; Puzzle,,"A and B are at the top because they focus on the car, customized a bit in the environment. In this type of game, I would care less about the character visual and that has more of a focus in the other 3 choices. I ranked them in descending order of how much I liked the look of the character. Choice E got bonus points because it was easier for me to see the character's ""shadow"" image above the car."
3136,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Action; Adventure; Role Playing; Simulation; Strategy,,"I love E the most. The character looks strong and intimidating, with an outfit that actually matches the color scheme of the car very nicely."
3137,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Strategy; Sports; Action; Adventure; Educational,,"Option E is my favorite concept art for the theme because the main character looks the part the most effectively, mainly because of the darker colors of her clothing and the accessories she has which appear more post apocalyptic than those of the other characters."
3138,Male,$101k+,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Sports; Board; Puzzle,,I really like the concept art of the images as they fit the description of post apocalypse  vehicles.  I especially like option B because I like the rugged design of the vehicle and it almost looks like a water color painting which makes it stand out from the rest.
3139,Male,$0-30k,Other,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Trivia; Strategy; Simulation; Puzzle; Action,,I like the concept art from A the most. It looks rugged and it also looks like it would be good in a combat situation. I think similarly about choice B. I really liked the artwork. Choices E and C could go either way for me. I went with E just because the shot is a little more focused so I could see it better. Choice D is my least favorite. It isn't that big of a drop off but something about her clothing doesn't fit in with the concept for me.
3140,Male,$0-30k,Black,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Action; Adventure; Role Playing; Word,,The last three look like racing cars more than post apocalyptic cars. I like the grungier look and the dirtier look.
3141,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Strategy; Word,,"I don't really care to see the characters understanding outside of their car. If I'm playing a game where it's mostly driving, that I don't care to know who is in the car. I just want to see The styling of the car's body."
3142,Male,$0-30k,White,Graduate Degree,25-34,Puzzle; Card; Board; Action,,"I love a character together with the car but the option E, she is very similar to the movie character that we all know. I really like option C, also D is good but maybe the character should wear that blue color."
3143,Male,$61-100k,Asian,Graduate Degree,35-44,Casino; Simulation; Adventure; Trivia; Sports,,Having the characters is much better. Good look with those instead. I'd go with option E as the top choice and love the girl's look and attitude. Nice hot-rod too. Option D is not bad for the post-apocalyptic stage. Option C is alright too. Love the car in option B. Best vehicle of the bunch. Option A is not bad either as a choice for the car only.
3144,Male,$0-30k,White,High School,35-44,Adventure; Casino; Puzzle; Role Playing; Word,,"The pink cars really grabbed me right away, very loud!  Also I love desert environments and that does match the proposed theme of the game well"
3145,Male,$0-30k,Other,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Role Playing; Puzzle,,A and B makes the focus the cars and the environment. E looks nice for having a person. C is okay too. D is the weakest to me because it doesn't sell the world as well.
3146,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Racing; Arcade; Board; Adventure; Action,,Her vehicle and weaponry and overall design and feel is amazing and I love how unique and different it all is as it does not look like anything that I have seen before.
3147,Male,$31-60k,Asian,Graduate Degree,25-34,Adventure; Casino; Puzzle; Strategy; Role Playing,,I liked the Avitar that was used for option E the most.  The Avitar used for D was the worst and i really did not like it.
3148,Male,$0-30k,Hispanic,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Action; Strategy; Simulation; Sports; Casino,,the designs look good but change the color of the car
3149,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Adventure; Card; Educational; Casino; Music,,I like the choice of futuristic clothing and style.
3150,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,35-44,Trivia; Casino; Card; Racing; Role Playing,,"I'd prefer to play with B/A's more lifted vehicle, looks like it would have much more off road capabilities.  I don't think I'd want the fast sports car in this type of game, probably not enough armor.  E and C's player character are alright, not memorable but I'd play with them if I had to.  I don't like D's bell bottoms and overall look"
3151,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Arcade; Strategy; Trivia; Role Playing; Simulation,,"I like the Birds of Prey vibe that is in Option E, which is why I ranked it as my top choice. Option B is last because the car doesn't have any elements that truly makes it stand out."
3152,Male,$61-100k,Black,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Adventure; Racing; Strategy; Action; Simulation,,"i think the concept art for all the options look great. I really like the overall design of the car used in Options E,C, & D. The care just look great overall and threatening. I also liked the design of Option B's care. It looks like a modification of a real Ford Mustang. Everything from the look to the guns is appealing."
3153,Male,$31-60k,Other,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Board; Card; Role Playing; Simulation; Trivia,,I like the chainsaws and spikes!
3154,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Arcade; Casino; Puzzle; Sports; Word,,"C,D, and E All look very attractive. The cars look bad ass and the characters look fun and exciting. I think it matches the theme of the game very well and I would be very interested in playing it"
3155,Male,$0-30k,Hispanic,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Sports; Adventure; Action,,I think that they are in an interesting art style that I feel could mesh well with a vehicle combat kind of game. E is the most intriguing design to me as it has a solid character design to mesh well with their car.
3156,Male,$61-100k,Hispanic,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Adventure; Puzzle; Action; Strategy; Arcade,,"the E reminds me of tank girl, very well done"
3157,Male,$61-100k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Strategy; Role Playing,,I liked choice E the best since the character looks intimidating and strong with holding gun in their hands. Choice A and B look too simplistic with just showing the car.
3158,Male,$31-60k,White,Graduate Degree,25-34,Adventure; Puzzle; Arcade,,I like seeing them the most being in motion without a character in front. That makes it look exciting and action packed. It feels like something is really happening and the car is useful and fast.
3159,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Trivia; Puzzle; Educational; Board; Action,,I don't really like 3 to 5 as much because I think the color is OK the weird see through shapes I'm not a big fan of period I think they're a little distracting.. 1 and 2A kind of like the pink but it seems like these colors would die very quickly in this type of environment. I'd like the way the weapon  are displayed a number one1 too
3160,Male,$0-30k,Other,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Card; Family; Sports; Trivia,,Option E is the best option because animated illustration  is well designed and simple to appreciate
3161,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Puzzle; Strategy,,"All of the cars are very cool, especially option B and A, but I think the character need a little bit more edginess added to them."
3162,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Adventure; Strategy; Role Playing,,"I don't like the extra-girly one, and also what looks like a battering ram on front of a sports car makes very little sense to me."
3163,Male,$0-30k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Role Playing; Strategy,,"Option E has a Harley Quinn like character, creates the sense of rebellion."
3164,Male,$31-60k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Arcade; Role Playing; Sports,,"A looks better to me, it has a very clean and crisp look to it. This art style is more aesthetically pleasing to me."
3165,Male,$61-100k,Black,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Adventure; Action; Role Playing; Strategy; Simulation,,"I like option E the best because I like the character and the car looks neat as well.  However, I would use the car shown in option A and combine it with the character shown in option E."
3166,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Puzzle; Adventure,,The themes are strong and have a nice amount of character details. I like the background concepts and the obvious touches from the artist are quite nice.
3167,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Adventure; Arcade; Casino; Sports; Trivia,,"Options E and C are especially enticing to me; they give the character and the car a unique flair and make me really interested to see more. Option D is strong, but not as good as E and C. Options B and A are much less appealing to me and seem more expected for this type of story. They're bland in comparison."
3168,Male,$0-30k,White,High School,25-34,Action; Adventure; Puzzle; Word; Music,,"B, I find the vehicle very realistic and it also looks very fun and exciting.A, I find the style of the vehicle very attractive and exciting, I like the design of the modifications.E, The vehicle looks fun and well modified, however I don't like the low suspension as it would have a harder time traveling off-road. I find the character quite attractive with the clothing choices and the details in clothing and skin.D, I dislike the vehicle's design, it has a very low suspension, I find the character slightly attractive.C, I dislike the vehicle's design, and the character's design is a little odd as it doesn't fit with the apocalypse theme."
3169,Male,$0-30k,Black,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Casino; Racing,,I picked A because the two chain saws on the bumper is pretty cool.
3170,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Sports; Role Playing; Arcade; Adventure; Action,,"Option B looks like something that would match the overall theme. The vehicle looks high quality, colorful enough, and something that would be fun to use. The other options are strong as well though."
3171,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Adventure; Casino; Music; Sports,,"I love this concept art and my favorites are C and E, in that order, because the characters are very engaging and the way that the vehicles are tricked out is compelling."
3172,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Action; Adventure; Strategy; Trivia; Word,,I like the chainsaws mounted on the front of A. It jumps out at me as the type of vehicle that would be cobbled together with scrapped parts after and apocalypse. I think it fits the description really well.
3173,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Arcade; Card; Educational; Puzzle; Music,,Im a fan of mad max for post apocalyptical fantasy so choice A and B looks like mad max
3174,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Casino; Adventure; Strategy,,I personally think the upward angled front bumper guards are ugly and also distract me from looking at the rest of the car design
3175,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,35-44,Action; Adventure; Role Playing; Simulation; Strategy,,"A I love the design so much it is perfect!, D I think is really good for the character but the car I would prefer as A . C is okay and so is E but they feel a little derivative (feels like Harley Quinn and Tank Girl sort of) B is just sort of okay , but no chainsaws nor as fun looking as A"
3176,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Adventure; Role Playing; Strategy,,Liked b the best.  Had a nice mad max feel to it and looks functional.
3177,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Adventure; Trivia; Music; Sports,,I chose the options that I thought would help me survive better as my top choices. All of them are pretty good though. My bottom options were more based on how I felt the person in the picture would survive.
3178,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Trivia; Card; Casino; Sports,,I like that the character is a female. I like her clothes period like the color of our cars re.... i think this one stands out the most

3180,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Adventure; Board; Card; Casino,,For the first two choices the detail is excellent and I like seeing the car in outside environments.   The other ones are just too cartoonist.
3181,Male,$101k+,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Casino; Action; Sports,,"I really like the pink cars, those are my first two favorite.  A looks more feminine than B.  I feel the same about E and C as Red cars and then am neutral about choice D."
3182,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,35-44,Simulation; Puzzle; Card; Board; Adventure,,The images in which there isn't a character are better because I can see the mods done to the car better.  They look more detailed and are more focused on just the car.
3183,Male,$0-30k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Adventure; Puzzle; Action; Strategy; Board,,"I'd assume you would want to have a high lift car that's pretty chunky in this setting, and Option B fits that perfectly. It also looks a little more grungy, selling the idea that things are hard to come by even more."
3184,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Strategy; Puzzle; Adventure,,I like option B the best because it look more rugged and badass. I think it looks much more capable of winning battles.

3187,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Casino; Trivia; Word; Action; Arcade,,A & B fit the mold.  The older cars built f steel.  The sporty Ferrari looking car doesn't real fit the theme

3191,Male,$101k+,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Arcade; Action; Adventure,,I would prefer a phone number of the options didn__ have weird characters in the front shadows and then vehicles in the back. It makes it very difficult to see what is going on.

3193,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,,,I prefer the option B character and character back story because she looks the best and does not smoke cigarettes like the other two character options. I chose option C second because I like her brown coat more than the gray coat that the option A character is wearing.
3194,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,I feel like option b is def the one i would want to flirt with the most.  The skirt in option b def is sexier.  Option a just doesnt appeal to me a lot.
3195,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,B looks more promiscuous while C looks more upper scale sexy.  A looks like a Russian hooker on heroin.
3196,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,"I prefer option B. She has the best hair. I would like options like Grand Theft Auto when it comes to flirting or going out with women in the game, which includes simulated sex."
3197,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,I think the woman in C is the most attractive and I think that B is the least. I think B is mainly because of the expression on her face. I think the way the woman in C's hair is and her face makes me most attracted. I don't know if I would want to date any of them but I would choose either C or A based on the images. I can't think of any other interactions that I would want.
3198,Male,$0-30k,White,High School,35-44,,,"Someone that would be smoking in a club, in these days, is someone I wouldn't want to be around due to allergies. So that limits me to just b."
3199,Male,$61-100k,Hispanic,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,I think that she is already giving off sexual vibes with the look on her face and that gaze. He outfit is already very sexy as well. So she would be the one that gets me going and I would love to go out with her to see what can happen.
3200,Male,$31-60k,White,Graduate Degree,25-34,,,"I made my ranking decisions based on the features I find most attractive in a female. I also chose the female that looked the least ""scummy"" in image."
3201,Male,$101k+,Black,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,I will choose option C first because she has a good dressing and also a cute smile as compared to the rest of the others then choose A because her face is more clear as compared to B which is slightly dull. I would date C because she is more beautiful than the rest then I would love the game to have a chatbox where the girls would say want the want or how to be touched.
3202,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,I think the lady in choice c is smoking hot. I would love to touch her all over and date her. She is sexy and looks professional too.
3203,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,,,I prefer dark haired and skinny.  Plus the others look a bit older which I don't find as attractive.
3204,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,I like option B because she is showing the most skin or at least has see through clothes on. She's also not holding a cigarette as smoking is a huge turnoff.
3205,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,45-54,,,The most sexually attractive is definitely C and I would date her. I would wanna have conversations about her sexual fantasies.
3206,Male,$0-30k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,I prefer option A looks attractive with the hair color. I find her stands out well.
3207,Male,$101k+,Asian,Graduate Degree,35-44,,,I do not like smoking and B is the only option without a cigarette.C and A are very similar. I like C slightly better due to the coat color.Additional interactions: voice activated talk.
3208,Male,$0-30k,White,High School,25-34,,,"B, the clothing choice is very provocative, I find it very attractive with it showing a lot of skin, and being transparent in areas. The facial expression looks very confident and attractive. I would enjoy dating this one as they look fun.A, the choice of lace top that is very transparent and shows a lot of skin is very attractive, however the facial expression makes me much less interested.C, the character looks very confident in her standing posture. I find her facial expression to be slightly attractive, and the clothing choice seems fairly conservative, showing little skin and being opaque. This makes me much less interested."
3209,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,"Option B has the most desirable outfit, and expression overall. She has a confidence to her, which makes her more attractive, along with her unique look."
3210,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,The character in A looks the most natural in the environment
3211,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,I like B. She looks like she would be a lot of fun. I like her expression. I want to undress her too. A looks mysterious and C looks sleazy. I like them all.
3212,Male,$101k+,White,Graduate Degree,25-34,,,"Seems like a boring idea, and the models all seem pretty standard for the game"
3213,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,Option B is the most attractive to me. I like her body and her hair. I would want to be able to have sex with her as well.
3214,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,Option C is my preferred choice as a character for this game.  She is hot and sexy and would make a strong character who is very attractive  and cunning at the same time.
3215,Male,$61-100k,Other,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,I would be most attracted to option C simply because of her look and what i imagine her personality would be like. I think i would be most likely to date option B. This person looks most kind i would say. I would want to have interactions with them that were mostly romantic or sexual.
3216,Male,$61-100k,Asian,Graduate Degree,35-44,,,Think option C has the best character. Think she would have the best look here of the three. They are all beautiful overall. This would be great and think she is the best model in option C here.
3217,Male,$0-30k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,Options B and C of a two piece outfit make it more appealing and leaves more mystery from a traditional dress.
3218,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,Her pose and her outfit make this woman very hot.  Plus it looks like she is wearing a push up bra too.
3219,Male,$0-30k,White,Associate Degree,25-34,,,I think the girls in A and C are the most attractive but I prefer the hair color and outfit in A
3220,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,25-34,,,"I like that option B has blonde hair. I also like the outfit she is wearing. I like that she is holding a drink, this tells me she likes to have a good time. I do not like that option C smokes."
3221,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,"B is the most attractive because of what she is wearing and her haircut. C and A are both ugly and look like dated porn stars from the 90s. C at least has a bigger chest, A has a weird gathering of fabric in the middle that almost looks like a pooch. Regarding other actions, I would just summon my wife or watch porn instead of bothering with anything in a game unless it helped me progress in some way like stats."
3222,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,35-44,,,"I LIKE THE BREAST SHAPE OF THE WOMAN IN C THE MOST, HOWEVER I LIKE THE OUTFIT OF THE WOMAN IN B.  I WOULD MAKE THEM A LITTLE MORE CURVY"
3223,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,"I liked option B, A and C looked like they were on drugs"
3224,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,The open-mouth girl gives off unintelligent vibes and nobody wants a chain smoker for a woman. My top choice has the best face of em all
3225,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,"Choice C is the one that I find to be the most sexually attractive and would want to date the most. I like the look that she has. She seems like she would be very foreign and very European, likely French. I feel like she would have that strong and sexy French accent and be someone who wants to be a good girl despite her current situation. Choice B is second because she seems like she would be the most sexpot of three of them. She would be the most flirty and vivacious. She would be the most fun to be with but might not be someone that I would want to date as much. Choice A is last because I found her the least attractive and thus would want to date her to least. Her face just looked a tad off and was too gaunt for my liking. As for other interactions the game could let me have? Maybe a system would you could give them gifts to try to earn their approval higher or something where you could end up dating one of them if you play your cards right."
3226,Male,$31-60k,White,Graduate Degree,45-54,,,"Does Lea Seydoux know you've photoshopped her head onto a more voluptuous body? Seriously, I loved BASIC INSTINCT, so of course the Lea holding the cigarette is the sexiest to me."
3227,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,"To start, my bottom choice was easy as her face looks odd the way her neck is bent. I like my top choice because I find smoking to be gross. It would be interesting to see how each one respond in conversation."
3228,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,C loojs hot and sultry but also a bit classy. The others look too 'working girl' like
3229,Male,$31-60k,Asian,Graduate Degree,25-34,,,I choose C because the clothes and her body creates a sense of arousing and appealing at the same time
3230,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,,,I would have to go with C because she doesn't have a cigarette in her hand like the other two. Cigarettes are a major turn off. I don't think any of them are dating material though. I can't think of any other interactions at this time.
3231,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,,,"3 looks a bit strung out because the head looks photoshopped on and separate from the body. 1 is nice, but looks odd because of the open mouth, but i really prefer the alcohol over the cigarette. 2 is okay, the tats add a bit of lower class feel to her though."
3232,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,The cigarette makes option C seem the most sexy and mysterious.
3233,Male,$0-30k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,I find the one in option B to be the most attractive. I like her outfit and facial expression.
3234,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,25-34,,,I love option C the mist because she is the most well endowed making this one the most sexually attractive.
3235,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,C is the sexiest option. She has the biggest breasts and a very provocative look on her face. I would prefer to date her over the others. The brunette is very attractive too. It would be nice to see them take their clothes off.
3236,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,25-34,,,I think B was most attractive and had the most enticing posture and overall look. I didn__ like A because she looked angry and awkward.
3237,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,,,honestly this one looks more sexy and dangerous and mysterious with more cleavage
3238,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,35-44,,,"I have a thing for dark haired women so I think my top pick works best, I'd want her to be my partner in the game."
3239,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,,,"I ranked these in the order of most to least attractive to me.  This sounds like a perverted game which is OK by me, just hope I never get caught playing it."
3240,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,,,Definitely B. Love her hair and outfit. The black pantyhose are amazing as well.
3241,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,I find smoking very unattractive so the two smokers are out.  I'd be most interested in dating B for that reason.  For other actions maybe network or get their loyalty to achieve some end?  The game system is not very clear from the prompt.
3242,Male,$0-30k,Other,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,A seems to be the best fit for the background in my opinion. It also so happens to be the most attractive of the 3. C and B are fine as well but aren't as exciting looking.
3243,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,,,I prefer the option B character and character back story because she looks the best and does not smoke cigarettes like the other two character options. I chose option C second because I like her brown coat more than the gray coat that the option A character is wearing.
3244,Male,$0-30k,Hispanic,High School,25-34,,,I definitely like option C since it gives her a sexual design well at the same time being classy. I also like option C giving her an older look while smoking a cigarette since it shows how stressing her job is.  I dislike option A and B since they make her look too young while at the same looking like a prostitute.
3245,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,,,"I really like option A, she is definitely the most attractive.  I like her style and attitude.  I love the trench coat."
3246,Male,$61-100k,Black,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,I like option B the best because she looks like she someone who is stressed out and just wants to have a good time.  She has a background to her that I think makes her vulnerable.
3247,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,45-54,,,The look in C is the most attractive while the look in option A presents the character properly.
3248,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,She looks like she's in control. She has a sexy look but definitely could do some damage if she wants to
3249,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,,,"B has a sultry look about her, plus shes not smoking"
3250,Male,$0-30k,Hispanic,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,I feel that B has the style and look that best meshes with the description that is given.
3251,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,,,C looks more like the bored wife of a mob boss than the assistant DA. B looks more like the assistant DA but does not look as jaded as described. A probably fits the best but I am unsure this character would dress so sexy.
3252,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,"A It__ very sexy and attractive. Her cleavage draws by attention in. The women in B is very sexy as well and has the best outfit, but her facial expression is bad"
3253,Male,$0-30k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,"I pick C, because I like her beauty and style and more seductive to look at and it makes my heart pump faster because the looks on his beauty that's why I picked her and she is suitable for it. And I rank the other two accordingly."
3254,Male,$61-100k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,I liked choice C since the character's hair color is the most appealing and eye catching. Choice C is also most attractive with the way they have their hips out looks enticing. Also choice C has a good color scheme which enhances the character's curves.
3255,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,The character in Option C is mostly attractive and sexy because of her outfit and pose attitude.
3256,Male,$101k+,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,,,C looks stylish yet slutty B is a milder take on this and A doesnt look as good with the darker hair color and lighter coat
3257,Male,$61-100k,White,Associate Degree,35-44,,,I like option B because the character's outfit is the most revealing.
3258,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,,,I like her with the srink Moreno than the cigarette. Alsp the ipen mouth is pretty sexy. All of them are but I find the drink a turn on rather than the cigarette. The second one is hit too even with the cigarette because inlove her hair more.
3259,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,35-44,,,"She is powerful, fashionable, and dresses for success. She wears all black, and knows what she wants."
3260,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,,,"Choice C I find more attractive based on her face, hair and out fit."
3261,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,25-34,,,"I think the background story fits A the best. She just looks like someone who would work in that profession and would do exactly what the description says. B and C aren't bad, but they don't fit the story better than A. I find B more attractive than A and C though."
3262,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,"I think she looks the most provocative, powerful, and dangerous in Option B, followed closely by Option A. That matches her character descriptions the best."
3263,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,I like A best. I think the dark hair fits the character description best. I don't think B fits the character description. She looks more like a street walker than someone trying to become assistant district attorney.
3264,Male,$0-30k,White,High School,25-34,,,"B, I find the clothing choice looks very attractive and looks like someone I could imagine using drugs and trying to seek attention.A, I like the clothing, it looks fairly attractive and also looks like someone that I could imagine uses drugs to relieve stress.C, this character looks fairly stable and confident, it doesn't make me feel like they use drugs, and also their clothing choice is less attractive."
3265,Male,$0-30k,Asian,Associate Degree,25-34,,,I like the classier character design of Option C. The other ones are too revealing and skimpy. I favored the options with more clothing.
3266,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,I chose option B because I like that this one is not holding a cigarette like the other two options are.  I also like the outfit that this one is wearing more than the others.
3267,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,"Option B is the most appealing look, compared to the character synopsis. She has a natural confidence about her, but its also easy to tell shes often at the bars, and struggles with a career."
3268,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,"Option B is the most appealing and most attractive to me, her outfit looks the best and the description seems to fit. Option A is also quite attractive to me. Option C based on her obviously promoting the cigarette plus the outfit did not seem so attractive to me."
3269,Male,$31-60k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,,,"I like the long tan coat in my top choice, which is classy and striking. Very cool design for sure!"
3270,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,Option C is my preferred choice for the role of Emma in this mobile game.  She is the most attractive because of her hair and short skirt and nice legs and sexy demeanor.
3271,Male,$0-30k,White,Graduate Degree,25-34,,,Although she mostly hangs out at a bar using drugs in both option A and C makes her look like a whore. Option A has some classy and represents both her sides.
3272,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,I think B is the most attractive. I am getting 'Stiffler's Mom' vibes from C
3273,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,I'd pick the broad that looks the hottest that has the nicest looking body. She looks like the type to do all that crazy stuff and get involved with gangsters.
3274,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,45-54,,,The option B is very sexy and has a beautiful picture to it.
3275,Male,$0-30k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,Option B of a two piece outfit versus a dress is more appealing.
3276,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,"I think C fits the best with the description and is also the most attractive of the options. B is pretty close on both accounts, I do not like C and don't think she fits. I think the facial appearance and the wardrobe really drive home the story elements, they come off as sexy yet detached."
3277,Male,$31-60k,Black,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,"Option A has some class that fits the idea of being a district attorney while still looking sexy and having some attractive to her design. Options C and B are bit over the top when it comes to the sexy which both of these options have a lot of, but I'm not really seeing these options as district attorney's."
3278,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,,,"To me B's look fits the description the best.  I don't find any of them particularly attractive, but I guess A is closest."
3279,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,"I think she looks super hot in the one I chose, also the background looks to be the best among the group. I just think her sheer sexy picture is the reason I chose it."
3280,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,Option A definitely fits the story best; this version of the character seems right for the story beats and has just the right amount of intrigue and allure. Options C and B are much less interesting to me; neither seems to suit the story.
3281,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,,,"I preferred C. I would call,her the most attractive to me, though none of them are really my type. I wish she wasn__ smoking though,"
3282,Male,$61-100k,Asian,Graduate Degree,25-34,,,I ranked the designs of the Emma character that I liked the most.  I liked the illustration of option C the most followed by the design of option B and then finally option A.
3283,Male,$61-100k,Other,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,"I most prefer option C. Like the look of the character and the back story. Makes for an interesting part to a video game. C is most sexually attractive to me, and the rebel characteristics interest me most."
3284,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,"I think she looks at least a little bit professional but worn out, which is how I imagine her job would be making her feel."
3285,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,Both options b and c are nice.  But I thought the skirt on option b made her a bit sexier.
3286,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,25-34,,,"I think that the way she is dressed and presents herself in option C makes her look the most professional amongst the options, which is important based on her previous line of work."
3287,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,I like that my first option is not holding a cigarette but my second option is most attractive to me.  I like the fair and thin look.
3288,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,,,"I think 'C' fits the best as in she looks the most likely to be an ADA of the three. As far as which one I find the most appealing, its also going to be 'C' as she has the Eastern European type of look that I tend to be drawn to. B, honestly, to me, looks like a vapid mess - and not the good type. I dig C's style of clothing and her general look of ""This woman will destroy you if you're not careful"" - its not a vibe I really get from the other two."
3289,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,,,Based on the background of being a district attorney the second place makes the most sense.  Seems like this person could have left lawyer dress for the day and headed out for a night of partying with only slightly different clothing.  The first place choice is the most sexually attractive.
3290,Male,$61-100k,Hispanic,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,I feel like her skin tone and hair match with the race of the character. I feel like holding a drink goes with the liking to be in a bar. Her outfit says she seeks adventure which can be the drug use.
3291,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,,,I like the black outfit that she is wearing. The leather mini-skirt adds an element of danger and sexiness to this version of the character. I also like her shoes. This was my favorite of the various outfits shown.
3292,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,25-34,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Board; Card,,The other 2 choices are too futuristic.
3293,Male,$0-30k,Hispanic,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Sports; Adventure; Action,,This futuristic Egyptian crossover is pretty unique and is able to draw my interest the most to it.
3294,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,35-44,Action; Adventure; Role Playing; Simulation; Strategy,,"A is the most accurate I feel but I think C looks coolest. but  based on background and what I know A fits the best by far, if you go historical fiction or fantasy then C is the best hands down"
3295,Male,$31-60k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Strategy; Action; Adventure; Arcade; Role Playing,,"The headdress in my top choice is striking and classy, and caught my attention. Very cool design for sure!"
3296,Male,$101k+,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Arcade; Casino; Card; Trivia; Role Playing,,B has the best view the one with  blue background is too much of one color She needs to wear a crown and have jewlery to signal her importance in this society. This looks more  like what i would think is more olympia
3297,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Casino; Puzzle; Racing; Sports; Action,,Option A have the more reality and have better experience of view.
3298,Male,$0-30k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Role Playing; Strategy,,Option A of the staff not wearing armor makes it more realistic and connected to the queen.
3299,Male,$0-30k,Hispanic,High School,25-34,Role Playing; Adventure; Action,,"I feel that option B is the closest to realistic it can get with the queen lookin regal and guards behind her; that's why it's my number one. I really love the idea of option C, of how back then ancient technology was superior than what we have now. Option A could work, but the men behind the queen look like commoners and I'm not sure if a queen would allow commoners so close."
3300,Male,$61-100k,Black,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Adventure; Action; Role Playing; Strategy; Simulation,,"I like option A the best because I like how the servants are dressed normal.  I also like the smaller crown she is wearing and the plants that are shown as well.  I would think this is how this would have looked like in real life, which makes it perfect for the game."
3301,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,35-44,Simulation; Puzzle; Card; Board; Adventure,,The blue background and hue adds a level of mystery and enchantment to the scene
3302,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Adventure; Board; Card; Casino,,The Greeks and the age of Olympians were simple time and just had simple robes/armor.  Thus Choice A seems more historically right.
3303,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Racing; Arcade; Board; Adventure; Action,,This darker scheme draws me in because it gives her a mystical quality that the others do not.
3304,Male,$61-100k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Strategy; Role Playing,,I liked choice B since the character looks Regal and confident while grabbing my interest. Choice C looks too futuristic and not as appealing to look at.
3305,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,25-34,Card; Role Playing; Simulation; Music; Strategy,,Option B makes Olympia look the most powerful and regal.
3306,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Trivia; Puzzle; Educational; Board; Action,,"I really prefer the coloring of number one over the other 2 it reminds me of the late sky and top of mountain. Howere between 2 and 3, i prefer 2 because it has them in armour which to me makes more sense since the gods were always coming down to fight."
3307,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Arcade; Simulation; Strategy,,"The background of conept A just makes more sense, closely followed by B. C is too futuristic and is not actually a historical background"
3308,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Music; Sports; Action; Arcade; Casino,,"While I do think it is perhaps the most, ""Cartoonish"" of the choices, the blue background just compliments the art very well and stood out the most to me!"
3309,Male,$0-30k,White,High School,25-34,Action; Adventure; Puzzle; Word; Music,,"C, I really like the night sky, and the clothing details, they look pleasant and attractive, including the armor the soldiers are wearing. I am very interested in this.B, I find the clothing looks very detailed and fits well with the theme, I also like the warm sun lighting, I feel interested.A, I dislike the clothing, they look very basic and with little detail it makes me feel less interested."
3310,Male,$0-30k,White,Graduate Degree,25-34,Puzzle; Card; Board; Action,,"the brighter ones are significantly better than the option C. Moreover, the details in B is better than A, option A is too plain"
3311,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Music; Puzzle; Sports,,"The image in Option C has all it takes for me, first the guards- they look like ancient time guards with that amour, the background and environment looks very appropriate and the queen too."
3312,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,25-34,Word; Strategy; Trivia,,"I like the daytime structure, as well as the relatively plain outfit of the character in A.  I think their posture speaks for itself and they don't need an overly ornate outfit.  If I had to choose though, I liked the outfit of C more than B."
3313,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Racing; Action,,The helmets give it strength and authority
3314,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Adventure; Strategy; Role Playing,,"I like the colors of the daytime scene, and prefer the more intricate dress."
3315,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Word; Puzzle; Strategy; Adventure; Action,,"this order makes the most historical sense, that last one is very sci fi"
3316,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Adventure; Music; Puzzle; Strategy; Educational,,Either Option B or A is nice as they both have realistic color tones but I like B because her warriors have more gold armor on
3317,Male,$61-100k,Asian,Graduate Degree,25-34,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Racing; Sports,,I ranked the images of the Goddess character that I liked the most.  I found the design of the Goddess in the night background in option C to be the most appealing followed by the image of option B and then finally option A.
3318,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Action; Adventure; Strategy; Trivia; Word,,"I like seeing the day time background, it looks cooler. I refer the more realistic looking snake. I am not sure what the deal is with the snake I__ B. You seem interested in history and portraying it accurately, so choice A looked best to me"
3319,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Sports; Role Playing; Arcade; Adventure; Action,,"Option C is visually stunning, and eye catching. The characters confidence radiates more with the blue background. It creates a darker type of atmosphere, and puts focus on the lighter colors that the character is wearing."
3320,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,Action; Racing; Role Playing; Simulation,,Definitely prefer the night theme.  The darker background just helps everything else really stand out.
3321,Male,$31-60k,Black,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Puzzle; Strategy; Role Playing; Adventure; Action,,"Option A seems to be more down to earth and watered down which isn't bad at all. I do like options B and C because of how cool she looks with the clothing, jewelry and head pieces, I also found option B day scenery to be more attractive than option C night scenery."
3322,Male,$0-30k,White,Associate Degree,25-34,Simulation; Role Playing; Word; Adventure; Action,,I think the background is most fitting in C and then I like the artifacts better in B as compared to A
3323,Male,$31-60k,Black,Associate Degree,25-34,Music; Family; Casino; Board,,The guard is well armored
3324,Male,$61-100k,Other,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Adventure,,"I really like the blue background for this game. The blue makes things easier to see, and the characters are more interesting to me."
3325,Male,$61-100k,Asian,Graduate Degree,35-44,Casino; Simulation; Adventure; Trivia; Sports,,"For Olympias, I like the crown and scene in option B. That is a great look and wonderful to see. I would go with that as the best look for the history game. This is excellent and shows a sense of regality. Option C is not bad either and looks wonderful as well. Nicely designed and imagined."
3326,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Simulation; Sports; Action; Role Playing,,Blue is my favorite color so I would definitely prefer C over the orange in B or A.
3327,Male,$61-100k,White,Vocational Training,25-34,Action; Adventure; Role Playing; Simulation,,Option A is the closes historically. The outfits in Options B & C are a little overdone for Greek/Olympian times. Option C is overall too futuristic.
3328,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Adventure; Arcade; Puzzle; Role Playing; Strategy,,I think A is the best because it shows an actual snake rather than a mechanical snake.
3329,Male,$0-30k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Board; Card,,I like choice A is visually appealing. I picked this because it stands out well.
3330,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Role Playing; Adventure; Sports; Strategy; Trivia,,"1. A: The color scheme with its whites and golds fits an ancient/classical theme very well, as do the men in the background with togas.  This feels the most realistic.2. B: The white/gold color scheme gives the game a good ancient/historical feel, but the heavy armor on the men in the background and the queen's jewelry looks a little too modern and futuristic.3. C: The blue nighttime shading, futuristic armor of the guards behind the queen, and the flying figures in the background all give this image an ultramodern feel that is completely out of touch with an ancient Olympian themed concept."
3331,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Sports,,"I think choice is the most attractive of the bynch, and also the guys in the background look more official and professional. Inlove how you can see every bit of detail in her face."
3332,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Adventure; Casino; Music; Sports,,Option A is my preferred choice because the overall design is more compelling and the appearance of the characters fits better with the concept of a civilization-themed mobile game.
3333,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,45-54,Action; Educational; Adventure; Arcade; Strategy,,I chose A because it seems to be the most historically and reality accurate.  She appears human and the snake she is holding seems real.  C is somewhat real except for the headgear of the guards.  C looks future not past.
3334,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Trivia; Card; Casino; Sports,,The realistic look of the picture is stands out. i like  how the guards are not overdressed and just in the background
3335,Male,$61-100k,Hispanic,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Strategy; Sports; Action; Role Playing; Racing,,I love the color and tint of this one. It gives me the most realistic vibes. I love the style of jewelry she is wearing as well. It fits with what I would imagine someone in her position wearing. The way the guards are dressed also fits what I have seen and would imagine.
3336,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Casino; Puzzle; Trivia,,I don't like the futuristic look of both B and C. I like the real snake in A and the people not being in space armor. I also don't care for the crown in C or the background with things floating in the sky.
3337,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Strategy; Sports; Racing,,"i think B has more bling, more details"
3338,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Casino; Puzzle; Action; Adventure; Sports,,I like the options with less jewelry and distracting head piece.
3339,Male,$0-30k,White,High School,35-44,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Role Playing; Puzzle,,"The title is history coming alive, so having a sci-fi or steampunk element seems rather far fetched, I went with the more grounded, real snake."
3340,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,25-34,Action; Casino; Arcade; Trivia,,"I like the gold and red themed look. I like how fancy and ornate she is in option B, it seems like it would be more like the colors of the times."
3341,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,Role Playing; Strategy; Action,,"I like the blue background the best, the yellow makes it seem like desert to me."
3342,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Arcade; Casino; Puzzle; Sports; Word,,"I think the headdress in C is more exciting, stands out and is more in line with what she would really wear."
3343,Male,$0-30k,Hispanic,High School,25-34,Role Playing; Adventure; Action,,"I definitely love option B. Not only does she look regal, the masked guard looks as if if he's her elite guard. Option A could also  work, but the guy whispering to her just looks like a common guard. Option C looks incredibly out of place with a robot(?) whispering to her and Cleopatra looking a  bit over the top."
3344,Male,$61-100k,Black,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Adventure; Racing; Strategy; Action; Simulation,,I think Option A looks the best out of the three. I like that he costume and the costume of her servant looks more realistic. The other two choices seem out of the ordinary and a bit unbelievable.
3345,Male,$0-30k,Hispanic,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Sports; Adventure; Action,,"I feel that the servants as human would make it more accurate, but also have a unique look to them."
3346,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,35-44,Action; Adventure; Role Playing; Simulation; Strategy,,"A is great it looks historic but adds a little flair such as the face mask of the man, I think A is too plain an C starts getting into unrealistic and scifi territory which is okay , but not if your playing a straight historical type game"
3347,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,45-54,Trivia; Sports; Racing; Puzzle; Action,,I think the style in B fits her profile well. The one in A looks good too.
3348,Male,$31-60k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Strategy; Action; Adventure; Arcade; Role Playing,,"The headdress in my top choice is striking and classy, and caught my attention. Very cool design for sure!"
3349,Male,$0-30k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Role Playing; Strategy,,Option A of the advisor and not wearing armor makes it look more realistic and connected with the queen.
3350,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Casino; Puzzle; Racing; Sports; Action,,The background of the image gives more visual treat for the Option A.
3351,Male,$61-100k,Black,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Adventure; Action; Role Playing; Strategy; Simulation,,I like option A the best because I like the head dresses that the servants are wearing and I like that the background makes it appear she is within the walls of her palace.
3352,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,35-44,Simulation; Puzzle; Card; Board; Adventure,,I like the design of the pharoah and the queen's outfit is simple which puts more focus on her as a character
3353,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Adventure; Board; Card; Casino,,I believe Option A is more real to the history.   The guards and the advisor has more simplified garb/apparel which represents more of the culture.   By the way Cleopatra looks extraordinary.
3354,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Racing; Arcade; Board; Adventure; Action,,This fits her persona of being in charge and very powerful and cunning.
3355,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,25-34,Card; Role Playing; Simulation; Music; Strategy,,I think her bracers and neck piece look the best in Option B.
3356,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Music; Puzzle; Sports,,The picture in Option C is my most preferred because ut looks very beautiful and royal.
3357,Male,$61-100k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Strategy; Role Playing,,I liked choice A since the character looks the most confident and realistic with a little bit of jewelry. Choice A attracted me with showing me more of her skin compared to choice C which looks more covered up and fake.
3358,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Trivia; Puzzle; Educational; Board; Action,,I don't really notice much difference between the 3 but in the 1st 1 just 1 and the 2nd one she has that extra neck piece which I like and the 3rd 1 the blue is a little bit brighter on the attendee but that's about it
3359,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Music; Sports; Action; Arcade; Casino,,"Honestly, I do think any of these would have worked just fine, as they all look pretty similar. That being said, Option-B did stand out the most to me and looked the most authentic."
3360,Male,$0-30k,White,High School,25-34,Action; Adventure; Puzzle; Word; Music,,"C, the decorations on the clothing is very detailed and distinguished, I am very interested in this, the buildings also look like proper pyramids.B, I find the clothing decoration very pleasant and the pyramids make me feel more interested too.A, I dislike the buildings in the background, it makes me think of modern times, and also the clothing looks fairly basic."
3361,Male,$0-30k,White,Graduate Degree,25-34,Puzzle; Card; Board; Action,,the human character is better than the ones who seems to wear a mask.  There are no significant difference though. I really like the woman character
3362,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,25-34,Word; Strategy; Trivia,,"I thought A seemed like the most natural and authentic looking depiction.  C struck me as very strange due to how much gold the male character was covered in.  I thought B was okay, but a little less appealing than A."
3363,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Adventure; Strategy; Role Playing,,"I like the headdress of he guy in the foreground the most in A, but for the background I like C and B a little better.  And for the queen I like the smaller crown."
3364,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Adventure; Music; Puzzle; Strategy; Educational,,I resonate with this option the most because the advisor looks like a human being and doesn't have to much gold outfitted
3365,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Word; Puzzle; Strategy; Adventure; Action,,"this one makes the most sense, i dont think the gold masks are worn in everyday situtations"
3366,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Sports; Role Playing; Arcade; Adventure; Action,,"Option A is the most eye catching, and consistent image. Each character looks similar in their artwork, and the color scheme transitions well in the scene."
3367,Male,$61-100k,Asian,Graduate Degree,25-34,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Racing; Sports,,I ranked the images of Cleopatra that I liked the most.  I liked the design of the man talking to Cleopatra in option A to be the most appealing followed by the image of option B and then finally option C.
3368,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Action; Adventure; Strategy; Trivia; Word,,"I preferred A because everything seemed more realistic. The people in the background look like actual people. They seem weird and animalistic in the other options. If you are interested in accurate historical depictions, choice A seems like the best one to me"
3369,Male,$31-60k,Black,Associate Degree,25-34,Music; Family; Casino; Board,,The guard is dressed in good colors.
3370,Male,$31-60k,Black,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Puzzle; Strategy; Role Playing; Adventure; Action,,"Option A seems to be more down to earth and watered down which isn't bad at all. I do like options C and B because of how cool she looks with the clothing, jewelry and head pieces."
3371,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,Action; Racing; Role Playing; Simulation,,"Option A definitely has a more natural looking character model.  And yes, I mean the design of the character model on the left.  So I think option A is a good fit.  I think it clearly conveys the scene, and does a good job of selling your vision."
3372,Male,$0-30k,White,Associate Degree,25-34,Simulation; Role Playing; Word; Adventure; Action,,I think the design in C looks the most fitting to cleopatra
3373,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Adventure; Simulation; Puzzle,,I think it__ best not to robotosize the people and show them as the actual people they were
3374,Male,$61-100k,Other,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Adventure,,I most prefer option B. The font is easier for me to read and look at personally. Aside from that they all are pretty similar.
3375,Male,$61-100k,White,Vocational Training,25-34,Action; Adventure; Role Playing; Simulation,,Option C looks the most accurate. Option A looks too much like the Inca or the Aztecs. Option B's chest plate and dress look too much like something from South America.
3376,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Adventure; Arcade; Puzzle; Role Playing; Strategy,,I think B is best because Cleopatra came along well after the pyramids were built.
3377,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Simulation; Sports; Action; Role Playing,,The assistant or man on the left in A looks more like what I would expect from Egypt so I would definitely choose that option.
3378,Male,$61-100k,Asian,Graduate Degree,35-44,Casino; Simulation; Adventure; Trivia; Sports,,Option A looks the best for Cleopatra. Good and the soldiers look more realistic. I like that feel and love the crown on her head. Options B and C are good but the soldiers look too fake in them.
3379,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Sports,,I like this one because she is talking to someone with no mask and you can see what he actually looks like. I think this makes for a more visually appealing picture than the others.
3380,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Role Playing; Adventure; Sports; Strategy; Trivia,,"1. A. The costumes of everyone feel generally realistic and compatible with an Egyptian setting, e.g. the guards wearing pharoah style head dresses.2. B: The queen looks like she could fit in an ancient Egyptian game, though the armor and masks on the guards is a little too modern looking.  Still, their exposed skin makes them more human looking and compatible with the historical theme.3. C. This image is completely out of whack with an Egyptian setting.  The guard in front is covered in futuristic armor, and Cleopatra's jewelry looks more like a modern Art Deco costume."
3381,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Adventure; Casino; Music; Sports,,I prefer Option A because the facial features of Cleopatra and the others are more pronounced and make it more realistic and interesting.
3382,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Trivia; Card; Casino; Sports,,I like the simple design. I like how you could see the city behind her ..I like the look of  the guards.
3383,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,45-54,Action; Educational; Adventure; Arcade; Strategy,,I chose A because it seems the most real with the dress of the individuals.  Mark Anthony might be whispering in her ear.  B  and C look like future not past.
3384,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Casino; Puzzle; Trivia,,I like the pyramids being in the background of both B and C and feel that is important. I don't like how C's person looks like a machine or a made of metal. That really throws me off and stands out. I like the headpiece better in B and A as well over the larger one in C.
3385,Male,$61-100k,Hispanic,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Strategy; Sports; Action; Role Playing; Racing,,This is the one that gives me the most realistic vibes. The way she is dressed along with her jewelry. The way the men are dressed as well. These remind me of scenes from the ten commandments.
3386,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Casino; Puzzle; Action; Adventure; Sports,,I prefer the more realistic servant headpiece.
3387,Male,$0-30k,White,High School,35-44,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Role Playing; Puzzle,,"Beyond the obvious sex appeal? I like the more realistic take on her advisor. Assuming the climate is anything like real Egypt, that poor advisor would be baked alive in no time in the full facemask and garb of B and C."
3388,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,25-34,Action; Casino; Arcade; Trivia,,"I like option C because everything she is wearing and her servant is wearing is pure gold, it feels more like what she would look like."
3389,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,Strategy; Simulation; Role Playing,,I don't like trying to put fantasy or science fiction elements into historical figures. I like option A the best because it seems like a true representation of the character from history.
3390,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,Role Playing; Strategy; Action,,I think A fits the best based on the head gear the people are wearing.
3391,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Action; Arcade; Role Playing; Strategy; Puzzle,,"The heavily costumed assistant in the last place choice is just to much face covering wise.  The assistants in the 2nd and 3rd place choices look a lot more realistic.  Additionally the jewelry worn by cleopatra in the third place choice is to large and heavy.  The jewelry worn by Cleopatra in the first place choice is a lot smaller and more understated, I think this fits better with the idea of a elegant lady."
3392,Male,$61-100k,White,Vocational Training,25-34,,,Option D is my favorite here. The skateboard and the 90's look really help with the girls rebellious bio. The skateboards also help her image. Nobody thinks a scooter is badass.
3393,Male,$0-30k,White,Graduate Degree,25-34,,,"option B and C are the most rebellious one but I think she had learned some stuff form her mother and these are worst 2 choices. Option D is the best one since she kind of looks like a regular girl but of course she is more than that, she is rebellious"
3394,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,Image in option E is the perfect picture of the character being describe. Taylor as a rebellious child is evident in the image of option E.
3395,Male,$0-30k,White,Less than High School Diploma,35-44,,,"I like D because it seems more realistic besides the Metallica shirt, most skaters I know don't listen to Metallica."
3396,Male,$0-30k,White,Associate Degree,25-34,,,"Personally, when it comes to the 'street' look, I prefer the classic style of when I grew up. More 90s and 2000s. So my favorite, easily, is B. That's how the sort of person in this backstory would dress and look back in those days, and it probably has a stronger place in pop culture and society than any other, even the more modern trends that should have replaced it thanks to media. If you did want a more modern look regardless, I would place E as second and D as third. That's a lot more in tune with what you'd actually see these days. I'm not particularly fond of either A and C, which give me a vibe more like 'hipster' or 'rebellious high school/college student' rather than person that's actually committed crimes and lived by their own wits. One of the first three are the only ones I'd take serious for this character."
3397,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,,,"i really prefer one and two. i think that since having the gum is her signature for her, it's important that it shows that she is chewing it constantly. 2 i think shows her more of a bad ass, between the stance and the skateboard - in both 1 and 2 - i think that works well to show her rebellious side."
3398,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,Taylor had a privileged and proper upbringing and I feel this would show in hear appearance despite her interest/fascination in street culture. I chose each option based on its showcase of a rebellious nature rather than one naturally acquired.
3399,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,I think having the gum as part of the character ties her story together.
3400,Male,$61-100k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,I liked choice D since the character fits the style and direction the best. The character is well dressed and fits the skater theme. I liked how the character is on the skateboard and has their jacket around the waist which fits the skater style.
3401,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,A woman being ready for an adventurous outing is mostly appealing. I like the themes based on travel and find those versions where the character is mostly prepared to be ideal as well as suitable for a gang-themed mobile game.
3402,Male,$31-60k,Black,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,"Options E and D fit the concept well and definitely seems more down to earth and street. Options B,A and C are good, but the styles are bit much."
3403,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,B grabs my attention because the character is attractive to look at.
3404,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,I like option B as I think the use of the scooter is unique and fitting for the description. I also like her beautiful hair. She looks the sexiest.
3405,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,"Options D and E, in that order, are the characters that best fit the description of the girl in the Capone family and the way she is dressed, with the bag, and her attitude and demeanor fit perfectly for this game."
3406,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,25-34,,,I thought the overall image portrayed by D and C best reflect the upbringing and home life of the character. The only choice I didn__ like was A because it seemed too extreme.
3407,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,,,"Based off the description I believe Taylor will rather have skate board over a scooter.  Also I chose the one making a bubble with her gum since that is what she loves.   Also she does not want to be lady, so more of Tom Boy look."
3408,Male,$0-30k,White,Associate Degree,45-54,,,They all seem a little cliche.  I think E and B seem a little less so.
3409,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,45-54,,,I prefer the style in B the most because it portrays the character as being irresponsible and also as someone from a somewhat respected family.
3410,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,I picked the choice I did because it sounds like the character struggles as a child with an identity but then did what she wanted as an adult.
3411,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,I like the styles that I most associate with street culture.
3412,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,"I think option B fits best because it has the best combination of casual and higher end clothing for the fashion choice which matches well with the story. The style is understated but effective at conveying someone who is from a more wealthy background who has chosen a different life. I like the scooter, I think it makes more sense than the skateboard. I like the hair color and the overall presentation is aesthetically more consistent with the story. For someone who wanders the sneakers make the most sense because they seem the most practical for someone who walks a lot. So I think option B most effectively conveys the theme and story with respect to several factors. I like option E second best because of similar reasons. The scooter makes more sense because it's a more versatile form of transportation in a city. Details matter a great deal and the sneakers and the old bag that the character is carrying for option E are more consistent with the story and so I like option E a lot. I just like option B a little bit more but it's a very close ranking because there's a lot about option E that conveys similar themes from the story description, I just like the hair color choice better for option B than for option E. Option A is my third favorite option because it has a skateboard and no old bad. The shoes however do still seem symbolically very consistent with the story because they look like walking boots which is still practical with respect to walking. So I like option E and B more but I think option A isn't the worst of the options it's just not one of the best. I think option D is my fourth favorite option because of the skateboard and the shoes seem impractical with respect to wandering a lot. The overall image is less consistent with the story description. The one thing that is consistent is the old bag, so that's something that keeps option D from being my least favorite option but otherwise there's some inconsistencies with the fashion choices and the described story that give me reason to rank option D as one of the lower rankings and so I did. Option C is my least favorite option for a variety of reasons. The fashion choices are very inconsistent. Aesthetically this option is the least pleasant overall to look at. The gum obscures the face. The skateboard seems like a less practical form of transportation. The shoes are much nicer than the rest of the clothing choices and so it isn't as consistent of a choice compared to some of the other options. I just don't like option C as much as the other options with respect to the shirt choice, and the overall presentation and so it's my least favorite option. I think option B best conveys some of the key details of the character effectively and so that's why I chose option B as my most favorite option."
3413,Male,$0-30k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,Option C looks like it has more lgbtq representation.
3414,Male,$31-60k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,B is the character design that I think fits the description the best. This character has a nice art style and looks detailed and realistic to me.
3415,Male,$61-100k,Asian,Graduate Degree,35-44,,,I like the more subtle looks here. Options D and B look best. She looks great in that chill but cool look on the skateboard in option D. Option B isn't bad and she is so casual. Options A and C are nice but seem too expressive and cliched for the role. Option E is okay but not a great attitude on her there.
3416,Male,$61-100k,Black,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,I like option B the best because I like that the character reflects her street culture style that she likes.
3417,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,,,"I like E. She looks real and believable given the description. I like that she seems to have attitude too, which makes her interesting"
3418,Male,$0-30k,Other,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,Option A is the best because the image is well designed and perfect for advertising the product
3419,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,C and A are the only options where this character actually looks gangster.  A looks like a super punk which would go to grunge concerts and get piercings.
3420,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,,,The outfit she is wearing seems modern without being forced. Most of the other images feel like stereotypes. I like the contrast of her red hair against the black leather jacket that she wears.
3421,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,I like option A the best because it looks most like a punk skateboarder.
3422,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,,,I prefer classic looks and would tend to gravitate towards that
3423,Male,$31-60k,White,Associate Degree,25-34,,,This photo looks the best and shows the product in the best detail. It also attracts the most attention and stands out more
3424,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,,,I do not like the look of the stocking cap in A at all. Option C seems implausible because kids don't chew gum as much these days. The girl in E looks more dumpy and less rebellious. Option D looks more realistic but I would imagine B as the best image to go with this story.
3425,Male,$61-100k,White,High School,35-44,,,Out of all of these options this one seems to be the most normal out of all of them.
3426,Male,$61-100k,Hispanic,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,For me it is all about the characters look. She has this sleek look with not a lot of fuss going on. Juts serious which is very good for someone in a gang. I also think that the color black is a good sign as its something that we associate with the mob and their suits.
3427,Male,$61-100k,Asian,Graduate Degree,25-34,,,I ranked the design of the Annie Capone character that I liked the most.  I liked the design of the character of option D followed by option C then option B then option E and then finally option A.
3428,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,,,"I prefer B. The look is still gang/street, but there is an heir of cool and sophistication. I also like the leather jacket."
3429,Male,$31-60k,Asian,Graduate Degree,25-34,,,I choose B because the image looks attractive and appealing as well as very unique
3430,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,,,The last place choice is just too 90s wanna be punk styled for me with the bright colored beanie and stance.  I like the first place two choices a lot as they make sense for the character and the use of the scooter gives her a much more modern street look.
3431,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,The beanie and skateboard are really nice touches overall with option A its not very stereotypical
3432,Male,$0-30k,Black,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,When with option b due to her rebellious attitude and how cool her outfit is
3433,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,"I think B is the best of the options, her appearance matches closest to the description and I see the edge that she has. I like the way she is rebellious and find her backstory fun."
3434,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,this order fits the look the most to me
3435,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,35-44,,,"I think my top pick looks best and what I'd consider a modern day rebel with her look, I especially like the added cigarette."
3436,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,B and e are too staged. A and c look cool but I think d conveys the personality best
3437,Male,$61-100k,Hispanic,Graduate Degree,45-54,,,I would rank them in this order with choice A being the best fit for the description.  The street culture reference ties to the skateboard and dress of the character.  I don't find the character very interesting and nothing really attracts me to learn more about this game from this character.
3438,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,45-54,,,I chose E first as she must look homeless.  It also says she is carrying a bag with her.  The scooter is a nice addition.  I chose D and A next as they look appropriate for a homeless teenager.  B and C didn't strike me as much.
3439,Male,$31-60k,White,Graduate Degree,25-34,,,"The skateboard is way cooler than a scooter, which is pretty lame in comparison. I read the info and this is my ranking from best to worst."
3440,Male,$0-30k,White,High School,25-34,,,"C, the character is chewing bubble gum, appears to have the bag on her back and has shorts that are ripped, this to me looks like she is rebellious. This character fits the best with the story. I find the clothing choices attractive and fun looking.A, the character's hat, holding a skateboard and wearing colored glasses makes me think of her as slightly rebellious.B, this character's colored hair, collar, and short belly shirt makes her look rebellious and wearing a backpack, which fits the story well. However I dislike the scooter, it makes me less interested.D, the character's loose shirt, skateboard and wearing a backpack with what looks like alcohol makes me think of the character as rebellious, however I don't find the overall appearance too attractive.E, this character looks fairly regular and non rebellious besides for the alcohol bottle in the bag."
3441,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,"This one reminds me more of a modern day person compared to the others.   I have a friend that is similar.  Due to this, this is my top pick"
3442,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Word,,"My top choice sticks out a lot to me.  It looks like a mysterious character, but a good looking guy as well.  This one kind of reminds me of Ryan Gosling."
3443,Male,$31-60k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Role Playing; Strategy; Simulation,,I like option C the most because it seems from the description he likes to keep a low profile and maybe blend in but yet look tough. Option B is a good fit too.
3444,Male,$0-30k,Hispanic,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Sports; Adventure; Action,,With the description that is given I feel that B's model design best reflects it compared to the rest.
3445,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,Action; Board; Card; Strategy; Puzzle,,I like the necklace choice and the tough arrogant look that this character has.
3446,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Puzzle; Adventure,,The descriptions that offer plenty of details are the most appealing. I find these background stories rather unique and not at all boring after the initial read.
3447,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,35-44,Casino; Adventure; Arcade; Action; Role Playing,,"I think in my top pick with his pose and demeanor, it matches his description the best out of these.  He looks rough and like hes had a tough life."
3448,Male,$0-30k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Arcade; Role Playing; Simulation; Sports; Puzzle,,B is the best option because he looks the most like a tough criminal. The haircuts of A and C look too much like a pretty boy.
3449,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,Adventure; Action; Role Playing; Strategy; Sports,,I think wheel man seems to fit best
3450,Male,$31-60k,White,Graduate Degree,25-34,Simulation; Sports; Strategy; Puzzle; Role Playing,,"Connor seems to have a lot of history and I think his neck would be full of ink with his face looking a bit rough. Option A matches that description. There is so much story to his back story and I think his overall ink and look both matches the story but also gives more of a story, both of which I am curious about. I think the others match the story ok but option A really stands out to me the most"
3451,Male,$31-60k,White,Graduate Degree,45-54,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Trivia; Educational,,"I strongly believe Option B looks the most believable Black Irish character, the kid who grew up in foster homes and had to bust heads to survive."
3452,Male,$0-30k,White,High School,25-34,Arcade; Card; Educational; Strategy; Puzzle,,These are the most attractive looking criminal for this description seen in C and B here
3453,Male,$0-30k,White,High School,25-34,Racing; Arcade; Role Playing; Strategy; Puzzle,,"Considering the characters rough background, I think choice A makes a lot more sense for the character design. The tattoos, facial hair, and the rugged looking face match a person who has had a tough upbringing."
3454,Male,$61-100k,Hispanic,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Strategy; Sports; Action; Role Playing; Racing,,I picked this one because of the art by his neck. I feel like this something that would fit such a character. A full neck tattoo seems like something a person matching this description would have.
3455,Male,$61-100k,Black,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Adventure; Action; Role Playing; Strategy; Simulation,,I like option A the best because he looks like he has lived a tough life and his neck tattoo looks like someone who has a rough background.
3456,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Trivia; Puzzle; Educational; Board; Action,,Although they're all very similar I like the 1st 2A little bit more he looks like a bad-ass he looks like he lives his life alone and he does look like hes been in jail at least some time period hes got a bad-ass look in all of them though I like the hair and the neck tattoo is the most obvious number one also
3457,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Adventure; Board; Role Playing; Simulation; Strategy,,"Option A has more of a ""gangsta lean"" going on and looks better for a Thug character"
3458,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Role Playing; Strategy; Puzzle,,A looks tough and has a face that really fits the heritage
3459,Male,$0-30k,White,High School,35-44,Adventure; Casino; Puzzle; Role Playing; Word,,"This guy seems like he'd have a tough guy attitude bigtime, so I think that comes across with him staring at the camera looking big and bad"
3460,Male,$101k+,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Puzzle; Board; Card; Strategy; Trivia,,"I ranked based on how intimidating the face looked. Given the background, it seems like he would be tough."
3461,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Adventure; Role Playing; Strategy,,A has the best detail and is most relate-able.  .
3462,Male,$61-100k,Asian,Graduate Degree,35-44,Casino; Simulation; Adventure; Trivia; Sports,,Option A looks great and he has a lot of character with the expression shown. He fits the Boston type very well. He looks like Ben Affleck in a way. Great look and idea. Option B is good too for a tough guy. Think that is a good fit there as well.
3463,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,Board; Card; Puzzle; Word,,B looks the most Irish to me and the neck ink is clear and looks good - and he looks interesting and like he has an interesting story. C looks mean to me.  A looks like a douchebag and I don't like his neck ink.
3464,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Puzzle; Sports; Trivia; Family,,"To me option B screams Irish from Boston. He looks the most mean and the one you would not want to mess with.  His face looks more Irish than the other two, and I can just picture his deep Boston Accent as well."
3465,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Action; Adventure; Strategy; Trivia; Word,,I don't like C. He looks like a dork. I think B looks the most believable as a character and fitting of the description
3466,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Strategy; Role Playing,,Option c seemed like the most interesting character. Cool story.
3467,Male,$0-30k,White,High School,45-54,Role Playing; Adventure; Action,,The elements that attract me the most are a style of hair and the overall look on his face. I like his pose as well in the background information fits the image
3468,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Word; Adventure; Racing; Sports; Strategy,,The stories all seemed fairly similar. I liked option B the most because I liked the neck tattoo and the look the figure provided the best. I then thought that A seemed more  natural than C.
3469,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Arcade; Music; Puzzle,,Looks coolest & most fun
3470,Male,$0-30k,Black,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Action; Adventure; Role Playing; Word,,The first two look tough. The first looks more intimidating than the rest. The last one looks bland and boring
3471,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Arcade; Role Playing; Simulation; Strategy,,"""B"" reminds me of a Boston guy, but I can't put my finger on why.  I think he reminds me of Affleck in ""The Town""."
3472,Male,$0-30k,White,High School,35-44,Puzzle; Educational; Word; Role Playing; Board,,Option B looks too disinterested. A looks the most intimidating. C is middle of the road.
3473,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Strategy; Word,,"Option a has too many tattoos, and option b is the scariest because he's not even looking at me"
3474,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Racing; Strategy; Action; Adventure; Role Playing,,I prefer Option B because he looks the coolest and the most relatable. I think he fits the character the most.
3475,Male,$31-60k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Adventure; Card; Role Playing; Simulation; Strategy,,I liked B the best because it gives off more of a loner feel to the character since it doesn't seem like he stares out at us like in C and A which fits the loner detail in the description.
3476,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,Puzzle; Arcade; Card,,"B looks most like a guy I would see in a gang. He looks like he would kick some ass. C looks like he would kind of fit in a  bit. He looks interesting. A is okay, but he doesn't look like he fits in a game like that."
3477,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Trivia; Sports; Role Playing; Adventure,,I think that the game in choice c is the better of the 3 choices and the ones I would rather choose.
3478,Male,$0-30k,White,High School,25-34,Action; Role Playing; Simulation,,I chose in the order that look like they would be the perfect star with manly looks like those out of a action movie
3479,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Action; Adventure; Educational; Strategy; Role Playing,,The character looks good and reminds me of Ryan gosling.
3480,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,Casino,,"I was drawn to option B initially more than the others. I think he looks more like the profile than the other two. His demeaner looks more natural than the other two options also. Option A and C were pretty close, but Option C looks like he is trying to look mean, so I like option A a little more."
3481,Male,$0-30k,White,High School,25-34,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Card; Role Playing,,I really prefer the style of B because it's a guy who has seemingly not been a wanted person and is someone who may be looked as a problem child. C is almost like B. A is similar but not as mean and hostile looking.
3482,Male,$0-30k,Other,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Role Playing; Puzzle,,A has the best look. B looks like A but a little worse. C has a different look which I don't think looks as good.
3483,Male,$31-60k,Other,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Board; Card; Role Playing; Simulation; Trivia,,I like the dark pants a lot more than his blue jeans look
3484,Male,$31-60k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Arcade; Role Playing; Sports,,"C looks a little more like the described character, I think they have a slightly younger look to their face."
3485,Male,$101k+,White,Graduate Degree,45-54,Adventure; Arcade; Simulation,,"I like the A/C posture better and the A ""do you really want to f*** with me"" facial expression elevates it over C."
3486,Male,$61-100k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Strategy; Role Playing,,I liked choice B since the character looks the most intimidating and strongest. Choice B also fits the character description the best compared to choice C which isn't as appealing.
3487,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Adventure; Board; Card; Casino,,I chose based on the face appearances and the tattoo on his neck.   I chose who looked the most Irish.
3488,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Adventure; Strategy; Role Playing,,As a fairly novice criminal I think less tattoos seem more appropriate.  The full neck tattoos make him seem more hardened.
3489,Male,$31-60k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Strategy; Action; Adventure; Arcade; Role Playing,,"The neck tattoo in my top choice is imposing, and adds a nice accent to the image. Very cool design for sure!"
3490,Male,$0-30k,White,Associate Degree,25-34,Music; Sports; Strategy; Trivia; Card,,"All three have the same backstory and I based my rankings on how they look as that is the only major difference. I thought A had too many tattoos and didn't have the appearance I wanted so that's third. The difference between B and C was close, but I preferred B's facial features more as I feel it fit his character a little better."
3491,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Arcade; Casino; Puzzle; Sports; Word,,"I really don't have a preference.  But, if I have to choose one, B would be it.  The neck tattoes make him look tough and strong."
3492,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,"The backstory on this character fits this overall theme the best as it sounds organic, truly engaging, well researched and well thought out overall"
3493,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,35-44,,,My top pick looks the most like her ethnicity and what I think based on the description. She also looks really tough and like she's in her element.
3494,Male,$0-30k,Hispanic,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,I feel that C's model best reflects the description given about the character.
3495,Male,$0-30k,White,High School,25-34,,,The lighter hair variant of this person fits the description the best in choice C here
3496,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,Option A is the most interesting character. Good backstory and motives that make sense.
3497,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,,,"I think A is the most attractive, and she just kind of looks like the kind of person who had a good life and isn't necessarily a bad person, but the circumstances of the hurricane made her turn to crime just to support herself and family."
3498,Male,$31-60k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,I think the picture in option A fits the description the best of a former dancer. This one has the look of someone who can clean up and look like a professional dancer.
3499,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,,,I like the bacckground better about being a dancer
3500,Male,$31-60k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,"I felt the black hair fit the character more because of her ethnicity. Between the two with black hair, I liked A better because I feel that the character described in the bio wouldn't bother to tie back her hair."
3501,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,,,I think that C has a more Cuban and dancer vibe than the other two.
3502,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,I think the darker hair sticks out more and better fits the character's background.  Either of the top 2 interest me to be honest.
3503,Male,$0-30k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,C is the best because she looks the most like a tough girl that can shoot with her short haircut and mean face. I can't tell much of a difference between A and B.
3504,Male,$31-60k,White,Graduate Degree,45-54,,,"Frankly, I think any of the three styles would work when one considers Delgado's background. However, I'm a big fan of Zoe Kravitz, so am putting Options B and A in the first slots. Note: I'd be careful re: image and intellectual property law here. No snark."
3505,Male,$0-30k,White,High School,25-34,,,"I like choice B the most. When I read the story, I envisioned the character would look something like choice B and not choice A or C. I think the short hair makes a big difference."
3506,Male,$61-100k,Black,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,I like option C the best because I think her hair style and the way she dresses fits her background and heritage perfectly.
3507,Male,$61-100k,Hispanic,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,I think that the way she looks in this picture would fit someone with this background ethnically as well as when it comes to her gang activities. B and A are both good for a latina gang female. I like the way she is wearing her hair as it is tough and ready for a battle to me.
3508,Male,$31-60k,White,Graduate Degree,25-34,,,"Jarelle's story makes me think of two directions: either she's had a lot of plastic surgery to hide her scars and feel more powerful or she looks really rough so she looks more threatening. I chose the one that looks more cover up because I think there's more of an interesting story and she has the money being in a gang. I also think it is more likely she would have had work done being that she was a dancer. That being said, if gone with option C, I could see that the hurricane and her life having done damage to her and she's using that look to her advantage which could also be an interesting direction to go. I think option A looks to be in the middle of the other two and just does not feel like it has as much as the other two going for it."
3509,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,"I chose Option A because I like the chicks with black hair more, idk more than that :)"
3510,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,The descriptions are mostly helpful in deciding which character to pursue. I find the details mostly suitable and appropriate for the genre mentioned.
3511,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,A has a hairstyle that best fits this characters personality based on the background
3512,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,,,I like the haircut most in 1 I think it goes well with thebcharacter description. She looks like a badass and that she could have also been a dancer or maybe she is to make money to support her siblings
3513,Male,$0-30k,White,High School,35-44,,,"I think a character like this would be kind of unkept, so I like the long messy hair.  I like that face better too"
3514,Male,$101k+,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,,,I ranked my choices based on the most attractive face and which seemed to best fit the ethnicity.
3515,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,C has the best visual detail.  Really leads into the character.
3516,Male,$61-100k,Asian,Graduate Degree,35-44,,,Each of the designs look good here. I like the lady in option C the most. This is a fierce look and think she means business. Think option A is nice too and she is very tough. Good artwork to bring her to life in each of these.
3517,Male,$101k+,White,High School,35-44,,,"A's face, skin tone, and hair remind me of cuban and African ethnicities.  C looks more hispanic, with lighter hair and facial features, so plausibly fitting in Puerto Rico.  B looks more African American with her hair style."
3518,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,,,"The A face looks like a nice person forced into a hard life.  Her hair looks natural and easygoing. In B her hair is out of the way so she's ready to throw down, but therefore she's a little less approachable. I just don't like the look of C."
3519,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,"The long hair in option A is what does it for me, it makes the character who she is. She just looks more Puerto Rican that way in my eyes.  Imaging her accent and just the despicable things she will get up to if you cross her."
3520,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,,,She looks best with her hair down. I like A. She has a Rosario Dawson feel that I find appealing
3521,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,I think B is the the better simpler story. Then I choose C and then A. I also prefer the look of A the best.
3522,Male,$0-30k,White,High School,45-54,,,I like her appearance in this background the best. She looks like a badass and sounds like one
3523,Male,$31-60k,Black,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,The first 2 options would be the best as they appear the youngest which would match the age given for this avatar. The first one has longer hair and I think that one looks the best compared to something like the third option which appears to be older than the criteria calls for.
3524,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,,,"The stories all seemed identical, but I liked character A the most as I liked the style of the long black hair. I then like the longer but tanner hair in option C next."
3525,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,Seems slickest & most realistic
3526,Male,$0-30k,Black,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,"Options A and B look too much like Zoe Kravitz. If option C looks like someone, I don't know who it is, so I would choose this one."
3527,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,"The face in ""B"" and ""A"" seem the same, but I like the hair in ""B"" more.  ""C"" seems generic to me."
3528,Male,$0-30k,White,High School,35-44,,,I like her hair in C the most. The angle of the gun in all three looks odd. I think both A and C fit the description better than B. Option C also looks a bit tougher.
3529,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,C and a to not look like real people. They don't seem to match their characteristics with the kind of hair that they have either.
3530,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,"I like A the most, because her look is the best. I think her hair fits the character the most, and looks the coolest."
3531,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,I think that choice B is the best looking of the 3 choices
3532,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,I prefer the dark haired and tomb raider style look to the characters.
3533,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,,,"Option A and B are good, but I thought the hair in option B looked more correct for the profile. The dark hair seemed to fit well with the profile. Option B also has a more serious face to me. I didn't think the hair in option C looked correct at all. Most of the other looks of the options, like the clothing, went well with the profile."
3534,Male,$0-30k,White,High School,25-34,,,I dig the look and feel of A the best and B is a close second option. I think C doesn't look as menacing. All fit the look of what is described but A just fits it perfect.
3535,Male,$0-30k,Other,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,The face is the best on A and B. A looks like the hairstyle she would use more than B though based on the background. C has a worse face.
3536,Male,$31-60k,Other,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,"Definitely prefer dark haired the most, long dark hair is primary pick"
3537,Male,$31-60k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,C looks the best to me. I think this character's face looks more similar to the description and they have a more distinctive and unique look.
3538,Male,$101k+,White,Graduate Degree,45-54,,,"These are very, very close. B seemed to look a little smarter/dangerous than A/C."
3539,Male,$61-100k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,I liked choice A since the design of the character looks the most intimidating and fits the description of the character the best. Choice C feels lacking and not as confident nor strong.
3540,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,,,"Since she is Spanish heritage, I think long black straight hair is most appropriate and relates best with the description."
3541,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,,,"I don't think the story really clarifies much.  It talks about her upbringing but not what she does now or why she's toting a gun.  So just based on being black mixed heritage, I think they're all fairly equal but I like the longer hair a bit more."
3542,Female,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,,,I like this Pierre's rugged looks and clothing. I would make him less controlling and bossy.
3543,Female,$31-60k,Black,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,He looks better with the jacket in any color. They blue is a good fit for him. C camo shirt is definitely a no and is too american..
3544,Female,$0-30k,Other,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,I think the gray jacket is the most controlled look that matches his controlling and body personality. It also looks like someone who went to business school. I think he would not choose to dress very casually or colorfully.
3545,Female,$0-30k,White,High School,25-34,,,"I like the look of Option D the most, but I personally would change his clothing and have him wear a dark navy suit. Other than that, I would change his controlling bossy behavior, it really makes me not like him in the least. Thank you."
3546,Female,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,"I picture him to be wealthy and somewhat arrogant so he should have an outfit that reflects that.  It should be sleek, stylish and on trend with designer style."
3547,Female,$101k+,Hispanic,Graduate Degree,35-44,,,I feel that choice D fits the profile best as a home improvement business owner.
3548,Female,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,,,The outfit suits the description. I think he'd be more desirable if he wasn't bossy or controlling
3549,Female,$61-100k,Hispanic,Graduate Degree,35-44,,,"I think C represents him more. Pierre sounds mature for his age and the clothes matches that, I would also include one drawing with tennis, golf  attire as it sounds it would be a sport he might like"
3550,Female,$31-60k,White,Graduate Degree,25-34,,,Seems most relaxed and relatable as a leader that is controlling but still somewhat empathetic.
3551,Female,$61-100k,Hispanic,Graduate Degree,35-44,,,C has a personality that is very controlling and on topic.
3552,Female,$0-30k,White,High School,35-44,,,"I picked H, A, E and B first because nit only did they seem true to someone that has good work ethics it also has a not playing sided. F, G, C and D were also good and had good stories but they were kinda on repeat and really didn't provide any new info. i loved all the clothes changes."
3553,Female,$0-30k,White,Graduate Degree,45-54,,,"The Pierre for the casual game main character I think is the best choice is Option C. I carefully read the character bios first and noticed the differences in the characters hair, clothing, and accessories. Choice C fits best with the bio because of the trendy way his hair is designed on his head, the small shadow of hair along his jawline . He is heir to a family business so he wears an expensive watch and white shoes. He's a great leader and wears a blazer in a trendy color with a printed shirt underneath. He oozes of money and the high life, yet works hard. I would not make any improvement to the Pierre I chose because I think he's the perfect fit for the main character of a game."
3554,Female,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,,,"I like option G the best, he seems to be more real life man.  Longer pants would look better."
3555,Female,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,"After reading the character description, B looks most like the pierre I'd imagined."
3556,Female,$61-100k,Black,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,I picked my favorite Pierce based on outfit because the descriptions are all the same. I like the shirt he's wearing in option G. I would make his background a little more exciting. It's kind of boring.  I would change from a home improvement business to marketing or something that fits a little more with his look. He doesn't look like he knows anything about home improvements.
3557,Female,$31-60k,Other,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,,,"Even though he's young and of a different generation, I 'd want the character to be dressed as close to business casual as possible."
3558,Female,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,I like the look of D the most. I like the color of his jacket and the sunglasses he has.  I think D and G are the best looking.  I would change the color of his hair but other then that I think he looks best for this.
3559,Female,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,I like the character in option H- the description seems to fit the drawing perfect.
3560,Female,$0-30k,Black,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,"F, B, and H don't fit the description, they are too casual or not A-type enough. Hair is a big detail of this and the bright colors make him feel more casual and playful. The more business like, the better and that he looks super carefully styled and manicured."
3561,Female,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,,,the bios are all exactly the same.  I chose in the order I liked the avatar. I would change it and make him smilier and more friendly looking.  He's a bossy rich boy and I don't want to play with him at all as it is.
3562,Female,$0-30k,Other,High School,35-44,,,"I think of this character as pretty fastidious, controlled, a bit reserved and almost icy and aloof. I think he would look neat and stylish and is particular about how he looks, making sure to look his best every time he steps out the door. I imagine him wearing cool colors more, favoring neat, masculine lines. Even his casual looks are more uptown, never really trendy, and even the more modern stuff has a classic twist to it."
3563,Female,$101k+,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,,,For me an arragont and strong man would dress a bit stiff and in dark clothing.
3564,Female,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,"Option A's appearance matches the description the most for me. He looks most like a leader in a business role and looks like someone who could be snobby, controlling, and bossy. If I were to add anything to the description I think I would add whether he was single or in a relationship or if he likes or dislikes animals. This really helps us get a sense of what kind of person this character is."
3565,Female,$31-60k,White,High School,25-34,,,"I liked the way the hair was styled. I feel it helps to make his face seem more chiseled. I dislike the addition of a tie in D and the loud colors in H. B and G have rolled up jacket sleeves, which I also dislike. C feels like it fits the bio description."
3566,Female,$0-30k,Hispanic,High School,25-34,,,"i wouldnt make him very empathetic. if he is controlling and bossy, empathy doesnt mend well."
3567,Female,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,I think this one looks the most like a leader and someone who can be bossy and controlling
3568,Female,$0-30k,Black,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,I chose option C because I think the blazer looks more sophisticated.
3569,Female,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,,,"I generally don't like Pierre and would stay away from him in real life. However, if you make the clothes more relaxed and attractive then that is better for me."
3570,Female,$31-60k,White,High School,25-34,,,"I like A the best. It makes him seem like a business man but not like an old business man. If I could change one thing to my Pierre, I'd make him have like a half smile to make him feel more approachable. He seems very stand offish now"
3571,Female,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,,,"1. A because I like the apparel, the look, and I think that the image goes well with the description.2. F because I like the look, the hairstyle, the overall image goes with the description.3. C because I like the style that he has, the way he presents himself, and find the description fitting.4. D because I like the the way he looks, the style, the way he matches the description.5. B because I like the overall look, the way he matches in apparel, the way the description is fitting.6. G because I like the more laid back style, yet still looking like the description.7. E because I like the more casual look, but still the classe supérieure vibe.8. H because I like the flamboyant look, the pattern attire, and the way it fits the description."
3572,Female,$31-60k,White,High School,25-34,,,I chose Pierre's that looked more professional since he is a business man and heir to the family business.
3573,Female,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,"I only like B and A, the rest look like D bags."
3574,Female,$31-60k,Other,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,,,G is my favorite because I like the outfit the best. It is the perfect mix of smart and casual that makes me like the character more.
3575,Female,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,From the description I would assume that he is stuffy and stuck up. I would think he would be all business and not fun.
3576,Female,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,"I liked Option A the most. I see Pierre in darker clothes, due to the controlling/boss side. This outfit was the darkest and has the least amount of pattern. I think the patterns would be too distracting from what he wants to do/convey. I think he keeps is outfits simple so he can focus on the work."
3577,Female,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,"I prefer option A because this design of a Pierre seems more appropriate to his description bio, a better fit. Maybe I would make him a bit more formal and classy but option A is in a right direction."
3578,Female,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,"H, F, and G, it's the shirt and the shirt/jacket combo with the sunglasses in the pocket. To me, those are looks that Pierre would have being the character he is. It's more of a laid back character but determined and bossy. He looks like he'd be empathetic and like he'd be a great guy all things considered."
3579,Female,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,,,character seems the most well to do in terms of dress
3580,Female,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,,,I prefer the more professional looking Pierre's. The style of dress in A and G best fits his described personality. The rest I ranked in descending order of professional dress.
3581,Female,$31-60k,Other,Associate Degree,25-34,,,The bios are the same but I prefer the pics with darker colored suits
3582,Female,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,,,"The color scheme on D, especially with the red pants, fits the characteristic of him being European, and just looks more like the appearance I would expect an arrogant person with European roots to wear."
3583,Female,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,"The last three options I selected at the bottom are terrible. They look like 80s characters from night rider or something. Unless that is what you are going for, definitely not the way to go. Option A looks the most fitting for todays fashion with the type of character that he is. He is believable as a controlling heir with that type of outfit.  Option G is just a little too casual and working class with the denim. Option D kind of conveys are foreigner look, so I am okay with that but it seems too feminine for the type of character that he is. The rest are just kind of forgettable."
3584,Female,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,"I think he looks more professional without the sunglasses.  The hairstyle did not make any difference to me in my choices.  I think the blazer looks more professional as well.  The tie did not sway my decisions at all.  I don't care for the shirts in options H, F and E.  Option G looks like a jean jacket and seems too casual for such a professional guy."
3585,Female,$101k+,White,Graduate Degree,25-34,,,D has the best outfit.  It's showy without being obnoxious.  A is classic.  F is funky and catches your eye.  E is horrible.
3586,Female,$31-60k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,,,I like to choose option G. because he looks cool and handsome.He works hard and a natural leader he pursue career success. but he is strict to others and empathetic and bossy . If he changes a little bit about bossy thing and controlling activities .he is a really good and young business man. he will success a lot.He will get a trustworthy employees. Anger makes a man losing so many good employees.h has to change his character that is the only advice to Pierre.
3587,Female,$31-60k,White,High School,25-34,,,I picked these options in this order according to which one seemed the most professional and descriptive. I picked the ones that had the best looking outfit that was highly detailed and matched the description of the character. I picked the ones that seemed the most interesting
3588,Female,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,I like the look of B the most and that he decided to stay back to learn more about business.  I think he could improve by being less bossy but I think it is also helpful because he just wants to succeed.  B reminded me most of normal person with highs and lows and wanting to always improve.
3589,Female,$0-30k,White,Vocational Training,25-34,,,"D,A,C and G have the blazer on in a professional way and is very empathetic looking in that order. B has a blazer but the sleeves rolled up looks less professional. E and F looks clean cut but more American. The way the design looks on his shirt makes him look more of a nice guy in H."
3590,Female,$101k+,White,High School,45-54,,,"Option G is my first choice because after reading his profile, this look just looks like it describes him the best.  This look gives off  the ""leader/bossy"" look the best to me.  Option E is a close second.  I like the style of the shirt and gives him a little bit more casual style.  It still fits the description very well.  Option A is nice but just not one of my favorites.  I don't care very much for the color choices on the rest of the options.  Something about each one, just looks a little off to me."
3591,Female,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,,,I really love the hair on Option F.  I think the slicked back yet loose look really seems casual and for some reason that really equals home improvement company boss to me.  I'm not sure why though.
3592,Female,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Arcade; Puzzle; Role Playing; Simulation,Daily,I strongly prefer the colors and styles in this one. It's colorful and fun. Love the furry theme.
3593,Male,$0-30k,Black,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Role Playing; Adventure; Puzzle; Simulation; Strategy,Weekly,"The varied and cute character collections for B, C, and F fit perfectly for the all ages casual type games."
3594,Male,$0-30k,Hispanic,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Sports; Adventure; Action,Monthly,C I feel looks the best. It has the best design to it and is able to draw my interest the most. It also meshes best with the light description.
3595,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Strategy; Puzzle; Role Playing,Rarely,"I love a good, dark themed, fantasy game. Option H seemed to capture that with the dark colors, the design of the characters and the name."
3596,Female,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,Action; Arcade; Puzzle; Role Playing; Simulation,Daily,"The first three, C, E and D, are my favorites out of all of these options. I would have to know more about the game to pick one because this is mostly just guesswork based on the short description. But I like the artwork in C better than the rest. I like the overall design in E best. And I like the little details in D best. The rest aren't appealing."
3597,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Arcade; Role Playing; Simulation; Strategy,Weekly,"""H"" is the only one I like.  It reminds me of a cross between WoW character design and Borderlands character design.  All the rest of these look like they were scraped directly out of a Cartoon Network show and appeal to children."
3598,Male,$31-60k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Role Playing; Strategy; Simulation,Weekly,I think either option A or F would be fun for the family. Option A has the zombie theme which is fun. Option F has modern warfare with animal characters which I think the kids will enjoy. Option B and C could be fun. I ranked the rest lower because they might not be suitable for younger kids. I like zombie lands because I like zombies. I also like the different animal characters in option F and it could fit any settings.
3599,Male,$0-30k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Arcade; Role Playing; Simulation; Sports; Puzzle,Weekly,I like D the most because it looks most like Final Fantasy. The theme looks like Anime and RPG.
3600,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,35-44,Casino; Adventure; Arcade; Action; Role Playing,Daily,"Since its for all ages, I think the more cartoonish characters work best for it, as well as the name Zombie land."
3601,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Board; Card; Racing; Puzzle,Daily,"Since it is an all ages appropriate theme, I prefer option A. I think the characters look fun, a little edgy, and family friendly. The theme seems to be animal gangsters."
3602,Female,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,Educational; Strategy; Simulation; Word; Trivia,Daily,I like the gritty girl power and the designs in this order the best. I am not really fond of the last 3 I had to choose. They are a bit too cartoonish for me.
3603,Male,$61-100k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Role Playing; Educational; Casino; Adventure; Action,Daily,The scheme and art style of Modern Warfare (G) is the most appealing and fits the name. Followed by Dying land. The artwork for all choices is done well but does not fit the theme of the name.
3604,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Action; Music; Simulation,Monthly,"D is my favorite of all of them because it's varied enough to appeal to multiple crowds at the same time. The girl looks very anime and that will draw in one crowd, but the two males are different, one similar to the anime style that looks cool but the other looking more cartoonish and making you feel like his wacky personality comes through. The theme of being like punk, outsiders is interesting and one that is proven to be popular."
3605,Female,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Strategy; Puzzle; Adventure,Monthly,"I liked the most detailed artwork, and one with a dark background, generally. I didn't like the ones that looked a bit young."
3606,Male,$0-30k,White,High School,25-34,Racing; Arcade; Role Playing; Strategy; Puzzle,Daily,"I really like the art theme in choice D. The character designs all look very appealing and fun and the image gives me a really futuristic feel, so I really like choice D a lot."
3607,Male,$0-30k,White,High School,25-34,Arcade; Card; Educational; Strategy; Puzzle,Daily,"The characters are a good fit for a modern warfare style game here, it looks neat to me this option for the bright vibrant colors and easy to recognize characters"
3608,Female,$0-30k,Black,High School,25-34,Board; Card; Educational; Puzzle,Rarely,The theme is trendy and sightly in layout. The design is bold and graphic.
3609,Female,$0-30k,Black,Associate Degree,35-44,Adventure; Puzzle; Board; Strategy; Word,Daily,D reminds me of a fave animated show I used to watch. Plus it looks really cool. E and H are also very nice and would get me to play the game the most.
3610,Male,$31-60k,White,Graduate Degree,45-54,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Trivia; Educational,Weekly,"Option G's modern warfare is cool because it looks as though it's set in the former Soviet Union at the dawn of the modernist age, prior to the revolution. But we have a daughter who loves video games and cool heroines and she'd love Option E's tough, cool women who can battle the guys and still look good!"
3611,Female,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Word; Puzzle,Daily,I like the characters that are more cartoon like - seem more playful and fun.
3612,Male,$0-30k,Black,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Strategy; Arcade,Monthly,I chose H first because i like the color purple with a dash of pink on the side
3613,Male,$61-100k,Black,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Adventure; Action; Role Playing; Strategy; Simulation,Daily,I like the design of the characters shown in option F the best compared to the other options shown.  I like the characters and I get a a superhero vibe from looking at them.
3614,Female,$0-30k,White,High School,25-34,Role Playing; Simulation; Action; Adventure; Puzzle,Weekly,I like B and H the best. I think the characters could have interesting stories and backgrounds and fit the setting  and name well.
3615,Male,$31-60k,Other,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Board; Card; Role Playing; Simulation; Trivia,Daily,I like the items they are holding in H and E. I like the guitar and the motorcycle
3616,Female,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Card; Puzzle; Music; Family; Trivia,Daily,"I chose f as my first opinion because it's more colorful and vibrant. The colors or the characters make their features stand out more. It makes it seem like their ""strength"" is more clearly noticeable, especially for younger kids."
3617,Male,$0-30k,White,High School,45-54,Role Playing; Adventure; Action,Daily,I like the art style in the first one I chose. What I really like about it are the poses and the facial expressions. I would say this is some kind of zombie hunting theme
3618,Female,$61-100k,Black,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Adventure; Puzzle; Strategy; Word; Card,Daily,My choices are based on the theme I like best and feel would best fit this type of game. My favorite was Option C. I like the color and characters used in this theme.
3619,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Strategy; Action,Never,"I like the darker theme in Option H most of all, and the art style feels less cartoon-y and more like an action game that i'd want to play personally."
3620,Male,$0-30k,White,Graduate Degree,25-34,Educational,Daily,"F looks clean, colorful, 2D.  B is similarly good. D seems similar to some anime style. B's style is a bit too blocky. E and H are 3D and C is too flat in colors."
3621,Female,$101k+,Other,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Arcade; Casino; Puzzle; Role Playing; Simulation,Daily,More than likely I would use all of these based on the type of game.
3622,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Strategy; Arcade; Puzzle; Trivia; Simulation,Daily,"I like the wasteland aspect of my first few choices, D having a more anime style than E it looks like. I even like the more bold look of B, and then it starts to get more unique with F, which I still think is a good choice."
3623,Male,$61-100k,White,Associate Degree,35-44,Puzzle; Trivia,Rarely,I like option E because the characters have a sexy and fun look to them.  I think the theme is a fun loving superhero theme.
3624,Female,$101k+,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Adventure; Role Playing; Simulation; Strategy; Puzzle,Daily,Option E is my favorite because it shows women being bad ass and strong. I would image that the theme of choice E would be based around street fighting villains which are mainly male characters to protect the city and citizen freedom.
3625,Female,$0-30k,White,High School,45-54,Adventure; Role Playing; Simulation,Daily,"I love the look of the characters in Modern Warfare and I would be intrigued to play it.  I, also, like the name Brawl Tribes and their characters as well."
3626,Female,$0-30k,Other,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Puzzle; Simulation; Role Playing,Daily,I like Option G and Option D because they look more realistic and they also have nice colors.
3627,Male,$101k+,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Puzzle; Board; Card; Strategy; Trivia,Weekly,"I chose Option A as my top choice, and ranked all choices based on which looked most appropriate for an all-ages game."
3628,Female,$0-30k,White,High School,45-54,Educational; Music; Role Playing; Trivia; Word,Never,I had a hard time choosing the best one as most of them seem rather sexist. The ones which actually have females have them dressed scantily and there is no diversity. I'm not sure thigh highs are all age friendly. Seriously needing a look over
3629,Female,$61-100k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Puzzle; Arcade; Word,Daily,"H and E are way too sexualized to be a family friendly game. And frankly, I'm tired of seeing female characters made that way. I like A and G best because they look fun and are truly family friendly."
3630,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Puzzle,Weekly,I like the more classic animation style of F and B over the other choices.  I like these choices because they are more familiar and remind me more of my childhood.  I really like the theme of big guns and attitude that F portrays.
3631,Female,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,21-24,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Casino; Strategy,Daily,"I chose Option F first because I think they are the most colorful, unique, and diverse set of characters, which was my same reasoning when choosing options A & B. I Chose option E last because its just unrealistic half-dressed women which makes it appealing only to preteen boys"
3632,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Arcade; Strategy; Trivia; Role Playing; Simulation,Daily,"Option E is last because it's a bit too sexualized for my tastes if you're making something that is meant to appeal to kids of all ages. Option F is the one that would appeal to both boys and girls the most in my opinion, and the cold and vivid colors are also a very nice touch that makes it stand out in a positive way to me."
3633,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Puzzle; Sports; Trivia; Family,Daily,"I like the more cartoonish characters, they look more fun and have more a variety that is noticeable.    The themes I like are the more upbeat ones, not the ones about zombies or death."
3634,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Racing; Arcade; Board; Adventure; Action,Daily,This has a unique clan of characters that almost look like a family and it seems very familiar but also very unique and fresh at the same time as they look to have the most interesting designs and mood to them.
3635,Female,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Arcade; Puzzle; Trivia; Word; Educational,Daily,"I love the theme of the first four, they are fun like in a cartoon way and also in an armageddon way as well. The other choices are kind of bland and the pictures aren't that exciting to look at."
3636,Male,$0-30k,Other,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Role Playing; Puzzle,Weekly,The first 4 seem better suited for an all ages and causal type of game. The rest seem a little too much and would feel a little too hardcore for the average person I feel. It would not be suitable for all ages.
3637,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,25-34,Card; Role Playing; Simulation; Music; Strategy,Weekly,I like the character design in Option D the most.
3638,Male,$61-100k,Black,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Adventure; Racing; Strategy; Action; Simulation,Daily,"I think Option F is the best out of the eight choices. Option F should easily appeal to people of all ages since they don't look too childish, nor do they look too adult orientated. They have a good mix of color, humor and personality about them."
3639,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Arcade; Casino; Puzzle; Sports; Word,Daily,"H is very attractive.  The art is very good, the characters look very adult themed, dangerous and cool.  The theme is bad guys saving the world from worse people"
3640,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,21-24,Action; Adventure; Role Playing,Daily,I just selected in order of design and color schemes / character artwork that seemed the most unique and appealing to me and that I feel would stick out among other mobile games.
3641,Male,$31-60k,Hispanic,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Adventure; Role Playing; Strategy,Daily,"I really like the art style of H the most, and i like how the center character's skin is purple, really makes her stand out.  If I had to pick a theme for it, probably fantasy rock.  Something like the old heavy metal cartoon."
3642,Male,$0-30k,White,High School,35-44,Word; Trivia; Racing; Card; Arcade,Daily,the text in choices b & h has a better alignment to the text and characters
3643,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,35-44,Simulation; Puzzle; Card; Board; Adventure,Daily,"I like the ""biker gang"" look.  I ride myself so this theme immediately appealed to me.  It would definitely interest me as it is a main hobby of mine."
3644,Female,$101k+,Hispanic,Graduate Degree,35-44,Word; Board; Casino; Puzzle,Daily,I feel that choice H shows the character in a fun light and makes the game look more fun for all ages.
3645,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Adventure; Strategy; Role Playing,Daily,"I think it's best if the characters look colorful without seeming child-like (as in A).  C and D the color schemes are too dull.  Also, no skinny scantily clad women like in E."
3646,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Puzzle; Adventure,Rarely,The characters are designed well and the emotions seem reasonable given the context of a casual game intended for all ages. I find the gradient background to be suitable and allows the artist's vision to shine through quite easily.
3647,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Trivia; Puzzle; Educational; Board; Action,Weekly,at wise i really like all of them except the last 2 i'm not as big a fan of. in particular the first is awesome. i think that the theme of the game is also more all ages friendly. althogh it mimics a line of games that's already out a bit. the artwork and theme for primitive man i is also my favorite.  the darker colors on some of them go with the themes too - like zombie land and waste land.
3648,Female,$31-60k,White,High School,35-44,Card; Strategy; Puzzle,Monthly,Since this is targeted for all ages I tried to appeal to that. I ranked these based on how clear the characters looked and how realistically they appeared as well.
3649,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Trivia; Card; Casino; Sports,Daily,I like the playful design. I think it stands out and I like the little cartoonish look of it. I think the game will be more kid friendly with this design
3650,Male,$31-60k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Adventure; Card; Role Playing; Simulation; Strategy,Daily,"For a game for all ages you can't go wrong with the anthropomorphic characters in F.  I feel that theme would be the most popular across all ages, and I liked the casual feeling given off by F."
3651,Female,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Board; Educational; Action; Music; Racing,Daily,I like this group as they seem the most real life to me. They are relatable which makes me more interested.
3652,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Adventure; Board; Card; Casino,Weekly,"Since this is all - ages game, I picked characters that I think are appropriate for kids.   Choices E and H are much more appropriate for people who are 16 years and older."
3653,Female,$61-100k,Hispanic,Graduate Degree,35-44,Adventure; Casino; Puzzle,Daily,"Definitely E, the character look more fun and hardcore, I think the theme is a fighting game with motorcycles and bad ass characters"
3654,Male,$61-100k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Strategy; Role Playing,Daily,I liked the artwork and style of choice B which is fun looking and shows promising artwork. Choice B has a colorful scheme which grabs my interest right away. Choice E looks to serialized which isn't age appropriate for children.
3655,Female,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Music; Role Playing; Simulation; Strategy; Educational,Monthly,"Background and font of B is best, but my favorite character designs are in F."
3656,Male,$61-100k,Asian,Graduate Degree,35-44,Casino; Simulation; Adventure; Trivia; Sports,Daily,The game Modern Warfare looks fun. Love the animals in option F. It's fun to humanize them and give them characters. This is the best look. Option E is nice with the three folks in the biking gear. The design is neat here. Love option B as the style with the thicker lines looks fun for all of the characters used. Excellent choice here too. Those three look the best to me and I would go with those themes as the most fun here. Love the fun casual aspect to the game.
3657,Male,$0-30k,White,High School,25-34,Action; Adventure; Puzzle; Word; Music,Weekly,"F, the style and colors are vivid and catch my attention, I really like the details put into the characters and clothing.A, I like the vivid colors and art style, it catches my attention and really interests me.G, the art style looks a bit basic with very consistent coloring and little details or textures on characters, I don't particularly find it interesting.D, I like the details and textures, however the colors look very consistent and aren't unique enough, it looks very similar to each other.B, the colors really pop and the vividness catches my eye, however I dislike the bold outlines of the characters.C, the colors are warm and make me interested, however I dislike that they are dull looking, and it doesn't interest me a lot.H, I really like the details and textures, however I dislike the amount of skin the characters are showing and the left character looks very disgusting with drool.E, I like the art style, and details or textures, however I don't think it is suitable for all ages as the women appear to be showing a lot of skin and underwear, however it does show weapons which are fine for everyone, it makes me have very mixed feelings about it."
3658,Male,$0-30k,White,Graduate Degree,25-34,Puzzle; Card; Board; Action,Rarely,"I really like the female characters in the Waste Land option E, with those motorcycles they remind the movie Mad Max.  The theme of the game looks like we are in a abandoned world, staying alive and building our own city"
3659,Female,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Adventure; Simulation; Strategy; Trivia; Action,Weekly,I chose the characters in the order of my preference of shopping based off of how badass I thought the characters were.
3660,Male,$0-30k,White,Associate Degree,35-44,Board; Card; Racing; Simulation; Strategy,Daily,I ranked them in order of being the most lifelike to me.
3661,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Sports; Role Playing; Arcade; Adventure; Action,Daily,"Option B does the best job at presenting itself for all ages. The artistic visuals are modern, eye catching, and very colorful. This would likely appeal to a wide range of ages, and would give the creators enough room to give the characters more personality."
3662,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Simulation; Strategy,Daily,"I enjoyed all pieces of artwork, so it was difficult to decide which was the best. However, I like the more cartoony options for whatever reason. I think the one that I selected as my top pick was something that had an art style like pixeljunk. I am not as big of a fan of Steampunk and Dusty and Faded looking stuff right now."
3663,Male,$0-30k,Other,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Card; Family; Sports; Trivia,Daily,Option F is the best because the illustration is well designed and detailed and highly colorful. These characters would be great for a video game or NFT
3664,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,Simulation; Role Playing; Arcade; Adventure; Action,Weekly,"Just straight up character design I liked Option D the best. The characters were unique and the attention to detail was great.  What game do I want to play, Option A. I like the ""Zombie Land"" theme, and it seems fun. The characters are colorful and seem to have their own personalities."
3665,Male,$31-60k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Arcade; Role Playing; Sports,Daily,"B is the best option in my opinion because it has a very good assortment of characters. The art style is distinctive. The characters look fun and they fit the style appropriate for all ages. F is also a good option, but I think B stands out more. The other options don't seem to be as appropriate for younger players."
3666,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Adventure; Trivia; Music; Sports,Daily,I like the options that align with my tastes.  The options that look fun in my opinion are the top options. The option at the bottom look odd to me or are more feminine.
3667,Female,$31-60k,White,High School,25-34,Arcade; Family; Puzzle; Card; Strategy,Daily,"I like F the most it stands out and looks super cute like something I would be interested in. A,B, and D also grab my attention and look interesting. I would not go out of my way to look at H,C,G and E just the picture along does not peak my interest on those."
3668,Male,$101k+,Hispanic,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,Action; Adventure; Puzzle,Weekly,"I like the design of the outfits. There are other good it, but this one looked best. The team seams like a post apocalyptic world, kind of like Mad Max"
3669,Female,$61-100k,Hispanic,Graduate Degree,35-44,None / other; Sports; Puzzle; Music; Adventure,Daily,D because I think that the squad looks like it features more comraderie and cohesion.
3670,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Action; Adventure; Strategy; Trivia; Word,Rarely,"When you say all ages, I am thinking it__l be appropriate for my kids.

3671,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Adventure; Casino; Music; Sports,Daily,"Options A and B, in that order, are my favorite themes and designs.  I like these more than the other because they are more engaging and would be more compelling for a casual game that is suitable for all ages."
3672,Male,$101k+,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Casino; Action; Sports,Weekly,F and A look similar to Despicable Me which I think has all ages appeal.  Option B I chose last because it looks like a spinoff from Total Drama Island which is highly offensivre.
3673,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,35-44,Action; Role Playing; Adventure,Weekly,G and d have a classical art style that makes me nostalgic
3674,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Casino; Puzzle; Trivia,Daily,I don't really care for the artwork in H or the look of the characters in B. I think H makes the characters look too adult for an all age game. I like the modern warfare style images in F and G and I like that they are animals in F. E and D have a cool theme with the end of the world items and weapons. I don't like how the big guy looks in C but I like the other two characters. A seems a little too cartoonish.
3675,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,Action; Board; Sports; Strategy; Simulation,Daily,I prefer the images that showcase the characters against a more neutral color toned background.  I also like the characters with more realistic and human like body proportions.
3676,Female,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Arcade; Board; Puzzle; Strategy; Word,Daily,I like A because of its brighter colors. It still looks post apocalyptic without taking itself to seriously. The characters seem to have distinct personalities.
3677,Male,$31-60k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Strategy; Action; Adventure; Arcade; Role Playing,Rarely,"I like the bright and fun colors used in my top choice, which is appealing. The blue and pink colors of my second choice also caught my eye. Very cool designs for sure!"
3678,Male,$0-30k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Role Playing; Strategy,Daily,Options D and G are not as revealing/objectifying to women.
3679,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Casino; Puzzle; Action; Adventure; Sports,Weekly,"I personally like the Waste Land option with motorcycles but I'm not sure this is appropriate as an ""all ages"" casual game.  Therefore, I think the more cartoon style of the Brawl Tribes is the best choice."
3680,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,Strategy; Simulation; Role Playing,Daily,"I really like the character design of the ""Modern Warfare"" set of characters. The design style of each character fits well with the other characters. They all have a feeling of realism that I appreciate. I also like the weapon design."
3681,Male,$101k+,White,Graduate Degree,25-34,Puzzle; Role Playing; Adventure,Weekly,C seems like the most unique overall though D and B have interesting elements
3682,Female,$61-100k,Black,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Trivia; Board; Word; Music; Puzzle,Weekly,I like the character style shown in option f. It's colorful and appeals to all ages. The character look age appropriate and aren't portrayed as sexy. It looks like anime style art and I like that.
3683,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Casino; Trivia; Word; Action; Arcade,Daily,"Judging by the uniqueness of the characters, A takes the prize.  The design of the characters and general level of cool all point that direction.  The colors, weapons and outfits all are very well done."
3684,Female,$61-100k,Hispanic,Graduate Degree,35-44,Action; Adventure; Puzzle; Role Playing; Trivia,Rarely,The details are cool and I can see that the characters are very well thought out.
3685,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Strategy; Role Playing; Simulation; Action; Adventure,Weekly,"I prefer heroes looking long and lean.  Combine that with the bikes, and I'm drawn into this style/theme easily"
3686,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Arcade; Card; Educational; Puzzle; Music,Daily,I definitely prefer the 2D look over the 3d models for sure. I like the less cartoony yet still sprite looking characters as well
3687,Female,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,Word; Trivia; Adventure; Card; Role Playing,Weekly,I like the look of the first one the best because the lady is fully clothed and looks triumphant.
3688,Female,$101k+,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Action; Word,Daily,I like the designs that look more adult and have an edgier look to them
3689,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Adventure; Arcade; Casino; Sports; Trivia,Daily,"Options H, D, and C all seem very unique and seem like new spins on old ideas. The character designs in these three choices are bold, exciting, and vibrant. Option H especially goes somewhere unexpected with design and makes me want to learn more. Option E is definitely good, but might be a little too sexy and scantily clad for an ""all ages"" sort of game. Options G, A, F, and B are all much less appealing to me, and they seem overly familiar -- like designs that aren't new or very interesting."
3690,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,35-44,Adventure; Simulation; Strategy; Trivia; Role Playing,Daily,"i like the characters in E with the sex appeal, i would be interested in learning more about the game"
3691,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Board; Trivia; Simulation; Role Playing,Monthly,I like the one with the animal it's by far the best. I didn't really care for the other ones.
3692,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,25-34,Action; Adventure; Strategy; Puzzle; Role Playing,Daily,A and C are my favorite because it looks like a very tough pirate but i love A the most because she looks the most feminine and also her facial eyes look like they are glowing white which is appealing
3693,Male,$0-30k,White,High School,25-34,Strategy; Simulation,Weekly,I like the art style of option C and I like that it's not overly sexualized. I like option B the least because it seems like a quick sketch.
3694,Male,$61-100k,White,High School,35-44,Educational; Strategy; Casino; Adventure; Role Playing,Daily,"C- She looks the most militant in her appearance. Her uniform, hat, and eyepatch very well suited to work with the Navy."
3695,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Arcade; Strategy; Trivia; Role Playing; Simulation,Daily,"In Option A, she appears as if she can seduce pirates yet also beat them on a one on one battle. She's self-confident. Option C is also far better than Option B design-wise, as in Option B, her face isn't shown well."
3696,Male,$31-60k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Role Playing; Strategy; Simulation,Weekly,I like option A because she fits someone that's has excellent fight skills with her carrying multiple swords and guns . Option C is a good fit too.
3697,Male,$0-30k,White,Associate Degree,25-34,Strategy,Never,"I would say that Choice B is my favorite rendition of this character. It radiates a lot more interest and intrigue, which seems to be what you're going for in the description for this character. I think it'd be cool to find out more about them, looks and otherwise, in story, with only vaguer images like this being what you get prior to diving in."
3698,Male,$0-30k,Black,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Role Playing; Strategy,Daily,Option C looks more in line with what a Navy pirate would look like in those times.
3699,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Role Playing; Strategy,Daily,"I like the option C character design the most because you can clearly see her face and front part of her body, and she looks very tough and exciting. I chose option A second because part of her face can be seen but only her backside is shown, which makes it difficult to determine how determined she is to be the best pirate fighter. I chose option B last because most of this character cannot be seen because it is drawn in dark black colors with her head pointed toward the ground."
3700,Male,$61-100k,Black,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Adventure; Racing; Strategy; Action; Simulation,Daily,"I really like Option A out of the three choices. However, I think Option C is also very good looking and fits the description of the character too. I like Option A the most mainly because of the pose. It stands out a lot more than the other choices."
3701,Male,$0-30k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Action; Adventure; Strategy; Arcade; Sports,Weekly,Option C posing got my eyes first compared to the others.
3702,Male,$0-30k,White,High School,35-44,Board; Adventure; Role Playing; Strategy; Simulation,Monthly,I like B best because she looks most threatening in that one with her face down and hat lowered. I chose C next because I like the barrel she has her foot on. And I chose A last because it just looks like she's modeling.
3703,Male,$61-100k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Strategy; Role Playing,Daily,I liked choice A and how confident the character looks while also being highly defined. Choice B looks too plain and simple which isn't appealing and looks incomplete.
3704,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,35-44,Action; Adventure; Role Playing; Simulation; Strategy,Daily,"B is perfect. it is strong and mysterious and powerful. C is a close second and also looks really good but I think B just hits it out of the park. B I dislike, it is over sexulized and kind of boring"
3705,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Arcade; Simulation; Strategy,Rarely,Option A is the best. I also like her pose in option A. Option B looks like a cartoon character with awful graphics
3706,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Adventure; Strategy; Role Playing,Daily,"I like the weapons an A better, but her pose seems silly and like it's just showing off her butt.  C and B are both good, just different styles."
3707,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,25-34,Card; Role Playing; Simulation; Music; Strategy,Weekly,I think Option C looks the most detailed and dangerous of the three choices.
3708,Male,$101k+,White,High School,35-44,Simulation; Strategy; Puzzle,Weekly,"A looks like she takes care of herself and keeps up on skills.  She relies on skill rather than appeal.  B looks ok, not as engaging as A though.  C looks more like she relies on appeal rather than skills, I don't see her as much of a pirate enemy as much as a free agent."
3709,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Role Playing; Simulation; Strategy; Puzzle; Card,Daily,"I really like the shaded barrel art, the back few is okay. The cell shaded look isn't great for me, it's fine but in a game I like characters to look more 3-D"
3710,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Strategy; Puzzle,Rarely,The two with the grayscale shading are much preferable to the one in solid black. The black one loses all detail. Of C and A I chose the one with the character facing front because it shows the character better.
3711,Male,$0-30k,White,Less than High School Diploma,35-44,Card; Role Playing; Adventure; Strategy; Arcade,Monthly,"I like A the best, it is the darkest and most gritty looking one with a nice touch of realism that makes you feel like you are actually looking at a pirate."
3712,Male,$61-100k,Black,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Adventure; Action; Role Playing; Strategy; Simulation,Daily,"I like option C the best because she looks like she's a battle hardened pirate, who gets what she wants and can use her looks as a weapon as well to get in the minds of her fellow enemy pirates."
3713,Male,$31-60k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Strategy; Action; Adventure; Arcade; Role Playing,Rarely,"I like the dual pistols in this choice, and the design of the hat is also striking. Very cool for sure!"
3714,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,25-34,Word; Strategy; Trivia,Rarely,I think the character in A strikes me as most resembling of working alongside the navy.  I also thought the looks that were turned away from the camera accomplished the intended feeling of reverence.
3715,Male,$101k+,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Casino; Trivia; Strategy; Sports; Puzzle,Daily,"She looks like a pirate, so would she be their biggest enemy? Shouldn__ that be a police or military person?B is the best, not slutty, looks strong and mysterious C -seems evil, maybe can__ die.   Wouldn__ want to see herA- looks like she is a brothel employee.  Not sure the need for her to have skin tight clothes."
3716,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Action; Adventure; Strategy; Trivia; Word,Rarely,"I prefer the pose and attitude in choice C, but the outfit in choice A. B is my least favorite because her face is hidden. I don__ like the gratuitous ass shot in A. I find that very cliche"
3717,Male,$0-30k,White,Associate Degree,35-44,Action; Puzzle; Strategy,Daily,"I really like the look of C and think it fits the best with the description. I like the added look of the gun smoke in the picture to show she isn__ afraid to fight. I think A fits well also but I like the added details that C brings. I think B is limited and the back picture looks mysterious, I didn__ think it fit the description."
3718,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Board; Simulation; Strategy; Puzzle; Role Playing,Daily,The character in A looks cool and unique
3719,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Puzzle; Sports; Strategy,Daily,"She sounds very mysterious, so I think B fits the description the best.  I like that her face is hidden and she is dressed in all black.  Her clothes look more like fighters clothes than the other two as well."
3720,Male,$61-100k,White,High School,35-44,Strategy; Simulation; Arcade,Weekly,"I would go with option C, this option just seems more realistic to me. All three options have some great detail though."
3721,Male,$0-30k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Role Playing; Strategy,Daily,"Option C has that dark antihero theme to it, adds a bit of mystery to the game."
3722,Male,$31-60k,White,Graduate Degree,25-34,Adventure; Simulation; Strategy; Sports; Trivia,Monthly,I like this character the best because of the sex appeal she has. A sexy fighter is a great fighter. I like her pants. I would choose C second because because I like her face better. She looks more human
3723,Male,$31-60k,White,Graduate Degree,25-34,Action; Adventure; Card; Puzzle; Strategy,Daily,I made my ranking decisions based on which pirate looks like the one to fear the most. Option B came first because it is simple and the art style shows she is not afraid to use those dual pistols.
3724,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Strategy; Simulation,Rarely,"I like A the best, she looks the toughest and captures the spirit of the description the most in my opinion. C is similar, just not quite as tough looking and B is too abstract for me."
3725,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Adventure; Puzzle; Role Playing; Strategy,Daily,I chose option C because I like all of the details in the character art.  I like the touch of having the barrel that she is standing on.
3726,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Sports; Adventure; Strategy; Role Playing,Daily,Option B looks the most like a fighter and someone to fear. Option C also looks tough but also very cliche and overly sexualized. Option A is even more sexualized and looks a bit ridiculous with a huge butt.
3727,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,18-20,Strategy,Daily,As position shows strength in my view
3728,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,35-44,Adventure; Simulation; Strategy; Trivia; Role Playing,Daily,i think the female character in A with the curves has the most sex appeal and i think it would help sell the game
3729,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Adventure; Role Playing; Simulation; Strategy; Action,Weekly,"I really like Option B. The covered face emphasizes the chest and then the eyes look at the guns. But I swear I've seen a photo like it before. Between Options A and C,  I really don't like just having one hip exposed in Option C so I picked Option A over Option C."
3730,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Trivia; Strategy,Never,"I think that option A appears the most realistic.  I would have fun playing as this character and making decisions.  The design is good and simple, yet cool and sleek."
3731,Male,$31-60k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Strategy; Role Playing; Simulation,Daily,"I think Option C has the look of the character description - a really good fighter, and a great pirate enemy. A fits the bill as well, with multiple swords but seems to be a more fan service-y portrayal. I am not a fan of Option B's art style."
3732,Male,$101k+,Asian,Graduate Degree,35-44,Adventure; Strategy,Rarely,"Option A is my favorite because the drawing has the most detail and her swords look wicked and deadly. I also really like option C with her guns, but dislike she has an eyepatch. I like the guns in option B and the overall look, but don't like the drawing style which feels less complete and more like a sketch draft."
3733,Male,$101k+,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Adventure; Action; Strategy; Role Playing; Simulation,Daily,B last because I don't like how you cannot see the face -- makes the character unrelateable. C first because she just looks confident and assertive.
3734,Male,$61-100k,Hispanic,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Strategy; Sports; Action; Role Playing; Racing,Daily,I think this is the nest character as you actually get to look at her face and the rest of her Giving you a little bit more insight into who she is.
3735,Male,$31-60k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Word; Strategy; Trivia; Card; Board,Daily,I like C the best because of how she is standing with one leg on the barrel which I think makes her look tough. B is a pretty cool pose with the guns but you can't see her face. A is a little too over the top with the butt pose.
3736,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Action; Adventure; Role Playing; Strategy; Simulation,Weekly,this image shows more badass-ery and a better/stronger/more fun vibe than the others
3737,Male,$61-100k,White,High School,21-24,Puzzle; Trivia; Strategy; Simulation,Daily,C reminds me of Captain Morgan and that's an iconic image.  A is better than B because A just feels fuller and more vibrant.
3738,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,35-44,Strategy; Simulation; Card; Word; Puzzle,Weekly,"C fits the description the best, she looks the most menacing of the three."
3739,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,25-34,Simulation; Action; Adventure; Role Playing; Strategy,Weekly,"For some reason I did not like the shading or whatever in option C. It looks like she has a black eye or a patch over her eye, and her face is making an odd grimace. It's a bit hard to tell with the shading, so I ranked it last. It might be better zoomed in. I preferred option C, it did show off some sex appeal, bu tit was also very highly detailed."
3740,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Puzzle; Strategy; Word; Simulation; Action,Daily,I made my choices based on which looked like a fully realized character (I realize these are just sketches/mockups). Option C is my first choice because they have the most pirate energy with the hat and barrel and stance - they are just the most appealing to look at. Option A is my next choice because it's a version of a sexy pirate which seems to be very prevalent in video games. And finally option B is my final choice because it looks more spooky and abstract and I can't imagine a world/game where this character fits or is super appealing to look at in a game setting.
3741,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Simulation; Action; Puzzle; Racing; Strategy,Monthly,A looks most exciting unique and strong. A is pretty good too. B is most plain and less detailed.
3742,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,25-34,Action; Adventure; Strategy; Puzzle; Role Playing,Daily,I love A and C the most and A  little more because of her face and eyes look like they are glowing and she looks very tough but feminine at the same time
3743,Male,$0-30k,White,High School,35-44,Word; Trivia; Racing; Card; Arcade,Daily,choices a & c's sketch work has more easy to spot detail and rich details at that.
3744,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Arcade; Strategy; Trivia; Role Playing; Simulation,Daily,"She's seductive, attractive, yet still independent and capable of damage in Option A. In Option B, she's too ""hidden"" in comparison."
3745,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Action; Word; Board; Educational; Puzzle,Monthly,I like that Marguerite's face is not showing because she's a master of diguise and the enemy will never see her coming to wipe them out. C uses sex to conquer her enemies and A is really a transgendered man whose feminine image  can fool anyone at any given time.
3746,Male,$61-100k,White,Associate Degree,35-44,Puzzle; Trivia,Rarely,I like option C because the character looks very sexy and intimidating.
3747,Male,$31-60k,Other,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Board; Card; Role Playing; Simulation; Trivia,Daily,I like the pose on A the most
3748,Male,$61-100k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Role Playing; Educational; Casino; Adventure; Action,Daily,The attention to detail on C gives this ominous vibe about the character. A would be next as it emits the same aura. B is just not cut out for this character due to lack of detail
3749,Male,$31-60k,Asian,Graduate Degree,25-34,Adventure; Music; Role Playing,Daily,"Option B was my first choice because I like how her face is obscured by her hat in that image, which gives her an air of mystery and makes that design more interesting. Option C was my second choice because I like how confident the character looks in that image, which fits with the provided description. Option A was my last choice because I didn't like how that image emphasized her sexiness over anything else about the character."
3750,Male,$31-60k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Role Playing; Strategy; Simulation,Weekly,When I think of fight I think of close combat and option A fits  with multiple swords and a gun. Option B is a good fit too.
3751,Male,$0-30k,Other,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Role Playing; Puzzle,Weekly,A is the more unique looking of the 3. C looks good but looks a lot like the character Miss Fortune from League of Legends. C is harder to make out since it isn't drawn as well to see features.
3752,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Racing; Action,Daily,She has a perfect mix of feminine qualities as well as strength and a powerful presence
3753,Male,$61-100k,Black,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Adventure; Racing; Strategy; Action; Simulation,Daily,"I really like Option A over the other choices. The way the character is illustrated and posed is just more appealing than the other choices. However, Option C also fits the description of the character well."
3754,Male,$0-30k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Action; Adventure; Strategy; Arcade; Sports,Weekly,Option C is very unique looking and she looks like no one will stop her.
3755,Male,$0-30k,White,High School,25-34,Action; Role Playing; Simulation,Daily,i chose a as the first as it looks the most detailed and has the best features for a pirate type character
3756,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Board; Card; Racing; Puzzle,Daily,"I really like the stance she is taking in option A, but more so than that, I love that she uses a sword instead of guns. For that reason alone, I would choose option A."
3757,Male,$0-30k,Other,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Card; Family; Sports; Trivia,Daily,Option B is the best because the illustration of the character is unique and appears to be a historically accurate representation of a pirate.
3758,Male,$61-100k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Strategy; Role Playing,Daily,I liked choice A since the character looks confident and ready to fight. Choice B looks incomplete and too loosely drawn.
3759,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Adventure; Strategy; Role Playing,Daily,The all black one without the shading is different stylistically and hard to evaluate against the other two.  But the more powerful and self-assured looking one is much better than the one that's just showing off her butt.
3760,Male,$0-30k,Hispanic,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Sports; Adventure; Action,Monthly,C I feel has the best design to it that meshes best with the description that is given.
3761,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Adventure; Arcade; Casino; Sports; Trivia,Daily,"All of these designs are strong, but option C exudes a strength and a power that the other choices don't quite match. Option C seems like a character that is smart, cunning, and knows what they can do. Options B and a both seem skillful and sexy, but neither of them suits the description as well as C."
3762,Male,$0-30k,Black,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Casino; Racing,Daily,I picked C because her stance emits the confidence I'd expect to see from someone with a reputation like what is described.
3763,Male,$31-60k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Arcade; Role Playing; Sports,Daily,A seems to be a more modern style character design which I find more exciting and appealing. I think this model fits the character description well and seems like they have good fighting skill.
3764,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Role Playing; Simulation; Strategy; Puzzle; Card,Daily,"I like the more 3-D looking one with the barrel art, it looks interesting. The back view is good but if you are going for a powerful woman, showing her butt is a bit demeaning. The last one looks a bit spooky or something but flat."
3765,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Adventure; Board; Card; Casino,Weekly,I picked the image A because she looked most detail/real and the most attractive.
3766,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Arcade; Casino; Puzzle; Sports; Word,Daily,"I feel the art in AA is the best. It is the most intricate and detailed. The character looks dangerous, tough, and very sexy"
3767,Male,$61-100k,Black,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Adventure; Action; Role Playing; Strategy; Simulation,Daily,"I like option C the best because I like how she really looks like a tough pirate, who is dominating and quick witted."
3768,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Trivia; Puzzle; Educational; Board; Action,Weekly,"1 is nice and reminds me a bit of a siren - sexy and dangerous. 2 is hard to tell what weapon she's holding but she looks like she stole a barrell from somebody, and 3 has a bit more of ghostly feeling to it."
3769,Male,$31-60k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Strategy; Action; Adventure; Arcade; Role Playing,Rarely,"I like the dual pistols in my top choice, and the design of the hat is also striking. Very cool for sure!"
3770,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Sports; Role Playing; Arcade; Adventure; Action,Daily,"Option A is the most appealing design overall. The character looks to have deep personality, and plenty of mystery behind them. Visually they are stunning, and the outfit draws in attention."
3771,Male,$0-30k,White,High School,25-34,Action; Arcade; Casino; Music; Role Playing,Daily,I prefer the focus on swords the most.
3772,Male,$0-30k,White,High School,25-34,Action; Adventure; Puzzle; Word; Music,Weekly,"C, I like this the most, the character has a lot of detail and at the same time has a lot of grit or dirtiness to her, the way she shows off skin on her leg makes me slightly attracted.A, I like the details in the characters clothing and weapons, her hat with the feather looks very interesting. The amount of skin shown around her back and her tattoos make me attracted, also the lighting and reflectiveness on her lower back side make me attracted as well. I like the detail in the weapons, they appear to be old and used in many fights.B, this character looks interesting, however the high contrast and little details make me less interested. The way the character is hiding their face, yet showing cleavage makes me interested, they appear to have high confidence. The smoking gun means it was shot recently."
3773,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Action; Adventure; Strategy; Trivia; Word,Rarely,"I don__ like the face in the shadows in B. I don__ like sexuality__ ass cheek pose in A. That__ very cliche. C is my favorite by default,. I like the attitude and the pose. Though I prefer the outfit in A"
3774,Male,$61-100k,Asian,Graduate Degree,35-44,Casino; Simulation; Adventure; Trivia; Sports,Daily,Marguerite looks dashing in option A. This is a great drawing and love the swashbuckler look. Awesome design and love the side view. Think that works the best with this and overall it is a fun pirate theme for her. I like option C as well and the eye patch with the high boots look great. Option B is not bad but less shading in the drawing and you can't see her face.
3775,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Casino; Trivia; Word; Action; Arcade,Daily,A is 100%. Showing her rear immediately caught the eye.  It__ the best option by far.
3776,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,35-44,Action; Role Playing; Adventure,Weekly,Seeing everything from the front makes me like C way more
3777,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,35-44,Simulation; Puzzle; Card; Board; Adventure,Daily,"I might be confused, but if she is supposed to be an enemy of the pirates, maybe she shouldn't look like a pirate herself.  She should stand out more with her own unique appearance"
3778,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Puzzle; Sports; Strategy,Daily,"She sounds very mysterious, so I think B fits the description the best.  I like that her face is hidden and she is dressed in all black.  Her clothes look more like fighters clothes than the other two as well."
3779,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Music; Action; Adventure; Arcade; Family,Daily,"I like option C and A, but I like Option C the most as the character looks more interesting. Option A is good, but due to the rear angle, it is more ""sexualized"" then option C. Option B isn't that good because the character isn't as detailed and you can't see their face."
3780,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Trivia; Card; Casino; Sports,Daily,I think the artwork is the best. It looks a little cartoonish but at the same time I think it's the best drawn picture out of the bunch
3781,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,25-34,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Puzzle; Trivia,Daily,"A has a clean, high quality, sexy look to the art."
3782,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Casino; Puzzle; Action; Adventure; Sports,Weekly,I like the options where the character is attractive yet somewhat frightening.
3783,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Adventure; Casino; Music; Sports,Daily,Option C is my top choice because she looks ready for a fight and is well equipped with weapons and demeanor.
3784,Male,$0-30k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Role Playing; Strategy,Daily,"Option C looks more mysterious and has that dark antihero theme to them, more relatable to average person."
3785,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,25-34,Card; Role Playing; Simulation; Music; Strategy,Weekly,I like Option C the most because it has the most detail and she looks the most dangerous of the three.
3786,Male,$101k+,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Arcade; Action; Adventure,Daily,I like choice c. I like the smoke coming out of the gun as well as The liquor barrel.
3787,Male,$31-60k,White,Graduate Degree,25-34,Action; Adventure; Card; Puzzle; Strategy,Daily,I made my ranking decisions based on which pirate seemed to be the most intimidating. I put option A because that style looked like a protagonist pirate and less of an intimidating pirate that is feared.
3788,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Arcade; Card; Educational; Puzzle; Music,Daily,The facial expression of the pirate is important to have and having the face fully formed is also important to me
3789,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Adventure; Role Playing; Strategy,Daily,I think all were good choices.  C was just better detailed.
3790,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Adventure; Puzzle; Role Playing; Strategy,Daily,I chose option C because I like all of the detail in the artwork.  I also like the added touch of having the barrel that she is standing on.
3791,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Sports,Monthly,"Choice C is the design that I think best fits for Marguerite because she looks the most badass here to me. I like how her outfit is one that you would expect from someone who works with the navy but is not part of the navy. It is professional looking but still has some sexy, feminine elements to it. I like the top that she has with all of the tassels and belts. I really like the hat she has and the eyepatch. Makes her look cool and intimidating. I like the pose with the guns. I also like how her pants her ripped on that one leg to show off her tattoo. Choice B is second because she looks really mysterious with all of the dark colors in her design and that you can't see her face. Makes her come off as someone whose name would be whispered with reverence. I like the outfit she has and how it covers everything up but still has a corset like top to add some femininity. Choice A is last because she came off as too sexy to me to be honest. That she would want to be someone who is out there, bold, daring. Who would make a big scene out of everything. I don't think she could keep a lower profile when needed which is what I feel the character description would require."
3792,Female,$0-30k,Black,High School,25-34,Action; Board; Racing; Role Playing; Simulation,Daily,I love the dying land a lot obetter than micro land. It makes it more interesting and the characters are a lot better put together
3793,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,35-44,Casino; Adventure; Arcade; Action; Role Playing,Daily,"I think the characters and the name Micro World are best for all ages, the characters look more cartoony and inviting in my top picks."
3794,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Adventure; Role Playing; Strategy,Daily,Liked the dying land the best.  Characters look like they__ fit right into the game.
3795,Male,$101k+,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Action; Casino; Role Playing; Sports; Racing,Daily,They all look good.  I think it must be like a farm or garden game.  Where you are farming to grow things.
3796,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Adventure; Board; Role Playing; Simulation; Strategy,Daily,"Dying land sounds and looks the coolest, and I like the design of the logo on Option C the best"
3797,Male,$0-30k,Hispanic,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Sports; Adventure; Action,Monthly,C I find to be the best mixture of design and the name of the game. It is able to stand out the most to me and be very intriguing.
3798,Female,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,Adventure; Role Playing; Arcade; Strategy; Puzzle,Rarely,"For something all ages the characters shouldn't be too scary looking. D looks appropriate on that and they're well drawn. Went down from there, with A and C being a bit too scary looking characters for younger players I think."
3799,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Trivia; Sports; Role Playing; Adventure,Daily,I think that choice C is the best of the 7 choices to look at and has me interested in that game.
3800,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Puzzle; Word,Rarely,Option F has a very fun and all-age appealing look to it.  It is also somewhat vintage.
3801,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Word,Daily,I prefer the more human-looking characters.  Those stick out to me and would be more fun to play with in my opinion
3802,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Trivia; Puzzle; Educational; Board; Action,Weekly,"i like all of these, but i really like the micro world idea better, it seems more family friendly than dying world. also i think that there is a lot that you can do with this one. i like the art in the order that i put them in, and i think that the micro world last one isn't as bright and colorful. i think that the dying world ones seem to not be as bright and colorful, i guess that's given the nature of the game."
3803,Female,$0-30k,Hispanic,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Puzzle; Board; Trivia,Daily,I like the style in option H because it would be interesting to see what items the characters use.
3804,Female,$0-30k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Adventure; Arcade; Simulation; Strategy,Weekly,"Option E, had my favorite design. It cute and the art-style stood out to me the most. I also liked the brighter pastel colors used. Option H and F was also good in terms of art-style but option E was my favorite. Option D, A and B looked okay. Not my favorite but not bad either. Option G and C, just had my least favorite design which is why I ranked it towards the bottom."
3805,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Action; Adventure; Strategy; Trivia; Word,Rarely,"I liked E. I thought it felt family friendly, as you describe. I like the characters and that there isn__ as much emphasis on guns."
3806,Male,$61-100k,Asian,Graduate Degree,35-44,Casino; Simulation; Adventure; Trivia; Sports,Daily,Great character choices in the Micro World game. My preference is for option D first. The characters are cute and the style looks great. It is more agreeable to me with a softer tone and palette in the style of the drawing. Option G is fun with the use of the the design and the way the lines of the characters are. This is a fun set of three characters here too. Option B is nice but the characters are tougher. Think that is good for older kids. I like option A as a nice twist on the size of the characters. Option F has a great set of characters but not as fond of the style. Option E is cool as well but the characters are less fun. Option C is not bad but also not a fan of the style as much. Option H is a bit too cartoonish for my liking. Good designs for the game and think it will be fun!
3807,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,Action; Racing; Role Playing; Simulation,Daily,Sign me up for Micro World.  Love that art style.    The option F art style is very appealing.
3808,Female,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Arcade; Board; Card; Casino; Puzzle,Daily,"I would like Option D. It looks light-hearted, fun and full of entertainment. It's very much my style."
3809,Female,$101k+,White,High School,35-44,Racing; Puzzle; Family; Arcade; Adventure,Weekly,So since it's an all ages game I thought to pick the ones with the characters that don't look too cartoonist like the last choices H and E. I like the choices with the realistic characters but that still have some quirks about them like choices A F D and B cause they look fun but still more realistic than the last ones. I feel like the first 4 choices would be more geared towards all ages.
3810,Male,$0-30k,White,High School,25-34,Action; Strategy; Simulation; Word,Weekly,Goofy and fun.  Dying land sounds like ripping off dying light and is bleak
3811,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Strategy; Role Playing,Weekly,I like the names and designs of E and C the most. Cool art style and interesting design.
3812,Female,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,Action; Arcade; Puzzle; Role Playing; Simulation,Daily,"The only one I even remotely like is B because the artwork matches the ""Dying Land"" really well and reminds me of some really great apocalypse comic book art. I especially like the costumes and how they're presented. It's a great mix of ridiculous, humorous and horrifying."
3813,Female,$101k+,Black,Graduate Degree,35-44,Adventure; Card; Casino; Puzzle; Racing,Daily,"I like the name ""Micro World"" much better than ""Dying Land."" Also, I like the art better when there is more color involved and when I can see the individual characters and focus on them individually.  That is why I like E D & H more than the others."
3814,Male,$61-100k,Black,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Adventure; Action; Role Playing; Strategy; Simulation,Daily,"I like option E the best because I like that the characters look like they are grandchildren, who are with their grandfather.  I love the flying duck!"
3815,Female,$31-60k,White,Associate Degree,25-34,Word; Board; Puzzle; Strategy; Trivia,Monthly,D sticks out to the me most.
3816,Female,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,21-24,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Casino; Strategy,Daily,"I chose Option E first because I like the art style,  and I prefer the options which have animals in them. I chose Option B last because I dont like the big weapons the characters are holding"
3817,Female,$31-60k,White,Associate Degree,25-34,Arcade; Puzzle; Trivia; Casino,Daily,I like the graphics of option F.  It looks like a fun game to play
3818,Male,$0-30k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Arcade; Role Playing; Simulation; Sports; Puzzle,Weekly,A is the best option because it looks the most like a cool anime.
3819,Male,$31-60k,Hispanic,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Action; Adventure; Role Playing,Daily,"I like the clothes, animal, and turret on F. I like the costumes on B, especially the girl in the dino outfit. A feels like the characters wouldn't exist in the same game. C is too edgy to fill an entire game."
3820,Female,$0-30k,Black,Graduate Degree,35-44,Adventure; Arcade; Puzzle; Role Playing; Simulation,Rarely,I really liked option H because it fits the audience age groups. This reminds me of Wreck It Ralph characters in the way they are drawn and the their weapons. The name of the game is age appropriate as well. It works for younger kids and older crowd without being too childish.
3821,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Casino; Action; Adventure; Card,Daily,"I liked the micro world title far more than dying land so chose those first.  Of Mircro world option G had the best art style for me.  Second was option F which felt not so cartoonish, but still family friendly.  After these two it started to get very childlike with options D, E and H.  Of the dying land choices option B was a clear choice because it was goofy but adult looking.  Followed by option C and A in that order."
3822,Male,$0-30k,Other,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Strategy; Puzzle,Rarely,I made my choices based on how playful the characters are. Choice B has my favorite are style. The characters don't look too goofy but also have unique costumes that give each of them a memorable personality.
3823,Male,$31-60k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Role Playing; Strategy; Simulation,Weekly,"I like the micorworld concept more. I think it would fit the all ages theme better. I think it would fun to have little characters using everyday small objects as weapons. I think Option G fits that the best. I like that you can uses the bird. I like that it uses the matches. If you go with Dying Land, I like option D characters. They look interesting and fun."
3824,Male,$0-30k,Black,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Role Playing; Arcade; Adventure; Action,Daily,"I think the theme with the more friendly looking characters are best, especially for this genre of casual. I like Option E because it shows how friendly the game may be, the characters look full of personality and bubbly. I also like the color scheme the best in comparison to the rest. Option G comes in close second."
3825,Male,$31-60k,White,Graduate Degree,25-34,Simulation; Sports; Strategy; Puzzle; Role Playing,Daily,I think option E is the most eye catching and looks the most fun. I think the theme is really cool  and looks fun for all ages.
3826,Female,$0-30k,White,High School,45-54,Adventure; Role Playing; Simulation,Daily,I like H the best because I think the characters are the cutest.  I don't like the name Dying Land.
3827,Female,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Arcade; Puzzle; Trivia; Word; Educational,Daily,"Choice G looks funtastic, like there's a lot going on in this image that I want to know more about. Choice C reminds me of an awesome disney movie. The rest of the choices are okay, but I can't see anyone liking them unless they like something that is similar to that, that they already like."
3828,Female,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Arcade; Puzzle; Role Playing; Simulation,Daily,"This artstyle is the cutest. I love the colors. They are very pretty. I like the design of the birds in the first two. They are very interesting to me. I like the action in the second one, but I like the cuter style in the first."
3829,Male,$31-60k,Other,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Board; Card; Role Playing; Simulation; Trivia,Daily,"Definitely prefer the ""bad boys"" looks compared to the cute ones"
3830,Female,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Strategy; Trivia; Word; Card; Puzzle,Daily,I'm not sure if something called Dying Land is going to be age appropriate for all but I prefer the design where the characters are more spread out and visible.  I like the animals included in my first choice because they are cute and I wouldn't mind looking at them.  The gardening theme seems the most relaxing and enjoyable.
3831,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Strategy; Word,Daily,"I think the reason I like options G, a, and E the best is just because I like the fun colors and happy characters. Some of them look like they're too serious and it wouldn't seem fun for me to play with my family"
3832,Male,$31-60k,Black,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Puzzle; Strategy; Role Playing; Adventure; Action,Daily,"Options E,H,D,F and G are really cool designs that give me adventurous vibes and is filled with wonderful fun things to do. The art styles are definitely unique, but it is that uniqueness that makes these options stand out."
3833,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Sports; Action; Adventure; Arcade; Role Playing,Rarely,It would be nice if the character interacted more with each other
3834,Female,$0-30k,Black,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Trivia; Word; Card; Family; Puzzle,Weekly,Option G has the best graphics in my eyes the colors aren__ to bright or too dull and the characters look like something in a game for all ages and one reminds me of a sonic character. A great mixture for both the young and old.
3835,Male,$61-100k,Hispanic,Graduate Degree,45-54,Arcade; Sports; Card; Puzzle,Daily,"I would rank them in this order with choice B as my 1st choice.  I like the way the characters are drawn in choice B.  Looks like a game I would like to check out.  Not sure if the name is for ""all ages""."
3836,Female,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Card; Family; Strategy; Puzzle; Educational,Daily,"I am not too particularly crazy about option H because it really seems like a Disney junior type game or app. It seems way too childish in design. I think E is only marginally better because it is slightly more quirky and different. It isn't quite so generic as option H. I really like option B because it seems like the characters are interesting, diverse and edgey enough to appeal to adults in a more wholesome non-threatening way - so it would still be okay for younger adults and kids as well. I think F is cool too but it doesn't have as many diverse examples. The rest of the options are just okay. They don't really jump out at me too much or really stick in my memory. I would definitely say the dying land theme would be the one I am not interested in than anything else."
3837,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Casino; Adventure; Strategy,Monthly,I prioritized my trios based on which caught my attention immediately and was also most aesthetic in comparison. The theme happy warfare
3838,Male,$0-30k,White,High School,35-44,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Role Playing; Racing,Daily,"D really fits the ""all ages"" motif perfectly, as it's not too cartoony or too realistic. I like the characters they look fun and unique, makes me want to know more."
3839,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Racing; Action,Daily,They are playful and hip. They appear likable to a larger group of players from different backgrounds and skill levels
3840,Male,$31-60k,White,Graduate Degree,45-54,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Trivia; Educational,Weekly,"Dying Land is too darn depressing, whereas Micro World is weird, cuddly, and a little creepy and I love it! Especially the wack bird airplane in Options G, E, and H."
3841,Male,$31-60k,Black,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Sports; Racing; Music; Casino,Daily,I love the rebellious look that the dying land options have and it looks like a game with an interesting premise while the micro world options resemble a mobile application.
3842,Female,$61-100k,Black,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Role Playing; Puzzle; Sports; Casino; Arcade,Weekly,I like this one because the colors are bright and caught my attention. I like the wording mirco world instead of dying land. I think boys and girls would like this theme i think it would be really funny to watch .
3843,Female,$31-60k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Puzzle; Simulation; Adventure; Trivia,Weekly,"I think my top 2 ranked options look most interesting and appealing to me. I really like both styles. Depending on my mood, they might switch spots for 1st and 2nd as well. It makes me want to see more characters, like other heroes I might like to play."
3844,Female,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Card; Music; Puzzle; Trivia; Word,Daily,I chose because I really like the colors and the style of the faces. it's very cartoony but it has elements of realism.
3845,Male,$0-30k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Adventure; Puzzle; Action; Strategy; Board,Daily,"Options C, A, B and G just seem too dark or violent looking for the ""all ages"" element. Option E would fit that criteria more, plus to me looks really calming and unique, making me just want to look at the artwork."
3846,Female,$0-30k,Black,High School,25-34,Board; Card; Educational; Puzzle,Rarely,The design is fun and creative. The design is conversant and approachable.
3847,Female,$0-30k,Black,Associate Degree,35-44,Adventure; Puzzle; Board; Strategy; Word,Daily,I like C the most. It has a steampunk feel and looks really interesting. I love the colors as well. The whole image really draws the eye.
3848,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Arcade; Board; Role Playing; Strategy; Adventure,Daily,The micro concept feels more wholesome and F shows the scale of the characters the best to me.
3849,Female,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Trivia; Word; Board; Card; Casino,Weekly,"I think C is the best out of these options and definitely my favorite. I like how it's all-ages appropriate, but it isn't ""dumbed down"" -- it's an attractive design that isn't too mature, but not too silly either."
3850,Male,$61-100k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Educational; Sports; Role Playing,Weekly,"Choices selected based on order of being ""friendly"".  I feel choice E is the most casual and friendly based on the colors and the look and design of the characters.  The one that is my favorite is G though as is seems actionable and upbeat within the image.  It seems the characters are ready to go."
3851,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Puzzle; Sports; Trivia; Family,Daily,"I like being able to see more characters than just 3, the are still is fun and unique, it looks like an overall fun game to play with so many different options of characters shown in the picture.  I like the Micro world theme more than dying world, because games should also just be fun and upbeat at times."
3852,Male,$31-60k,Black,High School,35-44,Strategy; Sports; Simulation; Casino; Board,Rarely,I chose images with art styles that are fun and detailed. I also prefer the Micro World theme since it is more upbeat than the Dying Land option.
3853,Male,$0-30k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Puzzle; Simulation; Strategy; Role Playing,Rarely,"I prefer the character designs of F because it has more details. It's more comic-like, and I personally like that kind of style. I really do like all of the options, but the less minimalist ones stood out to me more. I think I ranked the ""cuter"" ones lower, now that I think about it."
3854,Female,$0-30k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Adventure; Puzzle; Role Playing; Simulation; Strategy,Daily,Microworlds sounds like it would be fun. My favorite is the image of the MicroWorld where they are using household items. It would be cute to see what else they use as tools when they are so little. The Microworlds are my favorite because it is whimsical. Dying Land sounds like its kind of overplayed. Sounds like another shooter or pew pew type game which there are tons of.
3855,Male,$0-30k,Hispanic,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Action; Strategy; Simulation; Sports; Casino,Daily,i like the characters and the designs like interesting very cartoony
3856,Male,$31-60k,Asian,Graduate Degree,25-34,Adventure; Music; Role Playing,Daily,"Option C was my first choice because I liked the post-apocalyptic look of those characters and I felt their outfits were consistent in style with each other. Option A was my second choice because the look of those characters also was post-apocalyptic but their overall designs were not as good as those in option C. Option B was my third choice because that also appeared to be a post-apocalyptic game but I thought the character dressed up as a dinosaur felt too goofy in a bad way. Option D was my fourth choice because I liked how those characters had nature and plants incorporated in their looks. Option G was my fifth choice because I liked the general art-style of those characters. Option F was my sixth choice because I also thought those characters had an interesting art-style but it wasn't as good as the one in option G. Option H was my seventh choice because I didn't like the overly cartoony look of those characters. Option E was my last choice because those characters also looked too cartoony for my liking. Overall, my favorite style and theme for a casual game is a post-apocalyptic setting."
3857,Male,$0-30k,White,High School,35-44,Word; Trivia; Racing; Card; Arcade,Daily,"choices c,b,a,g blends the text of the game with the characters perfectly"
3858,Male,$61-100k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Role Playing; Educational; Casino; Adventure; Action,Daily,Dying lands steampunk art style is what makes it stand out the most. B has the best design and slickest characters followed by the other iterations in C & A.  Micro world is interesting but does not pop out as much.
3859,Female,$0-30k,White,High School,45-54,Educational; Music; Role Playing; Trivia; Word,Never,It does not seem like there is enough gender or race diversity in most of these. I prefer micro world for name
3860,Male,$101k+,White,Graduate Degree,45-54,Trivia; Word; Puzzle; Role Playing,Daily,I like the Dying Land images first and best in the order C A and B. The Micro World are next and in order of preference F G D E and H
3861,Male,$31-60k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Adventure; Card; Role Playing; Simulation; Strategy,Daily,I liked the styles with the sharper looks to them which is why B and G were my top choices. B was my favorite theme because I liked the unique dress of the characters especially the girl in the dino costume.
3862,Male,$61-100k,White,Associate Degree,35-44,Puzzle; Trivia,Rarely,I like option H because the characters look fun and playful.  It has a friendly and fun super hero theme.
3863,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Puzzle; Adventure,Rarely,"The themes I enjoy the most rely primarily on realism. I am more apt to select those designs that contain more realistic characters with expressions I can more easily relate to. I find the colors rich and vibrant, so those version were ranked more highly than more drab alternatives."
3864,Male,$0-30k,White,High School,45-54,Role Playing; Adventure; Action,Daily,I like the art style the best in my first choice and I feel it has a sort of motion to it. I'd like to facial features as well and ask for the theme I would say some kind of fantasy action adventure
3865,Female,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Simulation; Word; Puzzle; Adventure,Daily,"I would call my favorite modern cute style. I like it a lot, it's similar to the anime Chibi style and looks like it would be a lot of fun to play."
3866,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Action; Word; Board; Educational; Puzzle,Monthly,"I like F because it appears to be ""all"" age friendly. This graphic appears to be a ""Gadget"" family that is capable of making anything they can get their hands on. There seems to be a father, mother and a genius son who has more super gadget powers than hi s parents. I like that the mom travels by the birdlike machine that I assumed she built herself. I like that the father uses numbers to do whatever it is that he does with his super powers. I that the son is the only one with a laptop or tablet that he uses along with his super powers. However, the thing that really struck in the graphic is the chess like piece that looks like a Rook that the mother is holding. Note: The female here doesn't neccesarily have to be the mother. She could be the older sister who wants to make her missing/dead mother proud. But then we would have to come up with a storyline about what happened to the mother or at least why she is missing."
3867,Male,$0-30k,Other,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Role Playing; Puzzle,Weekly,"H, E, D, and G are the more unique looking art styles. They are more colorful and cute which will give the game an identity of it's own that would be more recognizable. The rest look more standard. A couple of them look like Overwatch for example. Or are more boring than the top four."
3868,Female,$61-100k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Puzzle; Arcade; Word,Daily,I like the more playful art style in H and E specifically and the name Micro Land. Dying Land does not sound family friendly.
3869,Male,$0-30k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Action; Adventure; Strategy; Arcade; Sports,Weekly,"Option D is far the best looking one in my opinion, it is very simple and eye catching in my opinion."
3870,Female,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Card; Puzzle; Strategy; Trivia; Music,Daily,The 1st 3 options I think were the best based on the characters and the name.
3871,Male,$61-100k,Black,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Adventure; Racing; Strategy; Action; Simulation,Daily,"I liked most of the styles presented here. I mainly liked Options E,G,D & B the most. They were very well illustrated, cute, and really fit all ages theme yo are looking for. If I had to just choose one, I'd go with Option E. That one is my favorite. I love the way the character's are illustrated and I like the duck with the helmet on. It just brings a smile to my face."
3872,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Board; Card; Racing; Puzzle,Daily,"Option B is my favorite style and theme. It looks very cartoony and safe for kids, but still has an edge and a darkness to it, that feels like adults would like it too. The theme seems to be a multiverse type of theme."
3873,Male,$0-30k,Other,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Card; Family; Sports; Trivia,Daily,Option F is the best because the cast of characters are very well designed and the illustrations are highly attractive to young audiences. This would make for a great video game or TV show.
3874,Female,$0-30k,White,High School,25-34,Action; Adventure; Board; Puzzle; Role Playing,Daily,"I like the colorful ones, they tend to stick out to me more, I like how much they pop and how attractive they look. I like the pinks and the duck is also super cute!"
3875,Female,$101k+,Hispanic,Graduate Degree,35-44,Word; Board; Casino; Puzzle,Daily,"I like choice G because I like how animated the group is but on top of that, the group is more colorful and eye catching."
3876,Female,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Board; Educational; Action; Music; Racing,Daily,I like the dying land theme. I like those characters because they seem funny and silly. They also seem the most real to me.
3877,Female,$61-100k,Hispanic,Graduate Degree,35-44,Action; Adventure; Puzzle; Role Playing; Trivia,Rarely,"In this case I have a top three favorite switch is B, G, H all of these images are something that I would like to see for this type of game"
3878,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Adventure; Arcade; Casino; Sports; Trivia,Daily,"While many of these options seem derivative and uninteresting to me, option F really stands out from the pack as a dynamic and fresh take on characters. The visuals are strong and exciting, and each character seems unique and fun in a way that really appeals to me. Options A, C, and D all have a certain verve and power to them, but none of these have the same immediacy as option F. Options F, G, H, and B all feel like they're too similar in style and design to characters that I have seen before, and I am much less interested in any of these."
3879,Male,$0-30k,Black,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Casino; Racing,Daily,"I prefer B, C, and A because the Dying Land characters look grungier and rugged."
3880,Female,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Casino; Word; Puzzle,Daily,"The name dying land gets my attention and makes me want to play to try and save it, and for an all ages game I prefer the look of the characters in B and A, they look like fun but not as cartoony as G and E, I think those would be perfect for a game just tailored to younger kids."
3881,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Role Playing; Simulation; Strategy; Puzzle; Card,Daily,"I picked the microworld themes before the dying land, I like the more whimsical styles above the serious and dark ones. The animish one is my favorite while the goofy one with toy vehicles and can armor is amusing. The dying land with the goofy characters is alright. The last two are just sort of dirty or gross looking."
3882,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Adventure; Board; Card; Casino,Weekly,"Since this is all-age game where the expectation of family is playing, I chose the ones that seem more family oriented and not have as many weapons and killing in the screen."
3883,Male,$31-60k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Arcade; Role Playing; Sports,Daily,"F is the best option in my opinion. I think these character styles fit the idea of an all ages friendly game because they're bright and fun looking, but they also seem to have some good personality with some distinctive characteristics. I really like B as well though these designs are a little less suitable for younger players which makes me favor F overall."
3884,Female,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Music; Role Playing; Simulation; Strategy; Educational,Monthly,"The Micro World ones have the more interesting art, but with a name like that I know their will be many Micro-transactions. I prefer Dying Land as a name."
3885,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,Simulation; Role Playing; Arcade; Adventure; Action,Weekly,I chose the more darker and sinister style characters. I gravitate toward these game themes more. Dying Land sound perfect.
3886,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,25-34,Card; Role Playing; Simulation; Music; Strategy,Weekly,I think the characters in Option D look the cutest and most well drawn.
3887,Female,$31-60k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Word; Puzzle; Arcade,Weekly,"To be honest, I'm skewing more ""positive and explorative"" than ""adventurous and dying"" here so I'm more interested in the ""Micro World"" game themes. Option E is appealing for both the character design and the color scheme. I'd be most interested in trying out this game and seeing how immersive it is."
3888,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Arcade; Casino; Puzzle; Sports; Word,Daily,A and B To me look like there for all age groups. The art looks more advanced. All the other ones look very childish in like they__e for kids. The theme would be a dying world/planet that you must save
3889,Female,$31-60k,White,High School,25-34,Educational; Adventure; Music; Racing,Monthly,I like bright colors and interesting characters. I don't like the name Dying Land.

3891,Female,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Adventure; Simulation; Strategy; Trivia; Action,Weekly,I chose the theme of the order of my preference but I would be most likely to purchase for family themed game.
3892,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Action; Casino; Role Playing; Simulation; Sports,Weekly,I think the sword looks way cooler and the whole design looks rad. I like the sun theme instead of the religious theme.  Looks like he'd wreck some fools.
3893,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,35-44,Casino; Adventure; Arcade; Action; Role Playing,Daily,"He looks like a more realistic character that looks more relatable, like a templar or something of that sort."
3894,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Adventure; Role Playing; Strategy,Daily,A is more proportionate and looks more realistic for game play.
3895,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Role Playing; Strategy,Daily,"I strongly prefer the option B character design because this character looks much stronger and more impressive than the option A character, and I like the very large sword that this option B character is wielding."
3896,Male,$61-100k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Strategy; Role Playing,Daily,I liked choice B since the character looks more confident and stronger. Choice A looks weak and doesn't look like they could even hold the sword.
3897,Male,$0-30k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Arcade; Role Playing; Simulation; Sports; Puzzle,Weekly,B looks like more of a warrior than A.
3898,Male,$31-60k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Role Playing; Strategy; Simulation,Weekly,I like option B because the character looks powerful and his sword looks better.
3899,Male,$31-60k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Role Playing; Strategy,Daily,I prefer the character in option B because I think he looks more interesting and charming to me. Option A looks okay but does not feel quite as intriguing to me.
3900,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Racing; Role Playing; Sports; Trivia,Daily,b because he looks stronger
3901,Male,$61-100k,White,High School,35-44,Educational; Strategy; Casino; Adventure; Role Playing,Daily,I prefer the more robust look of the armor and sword. Better color scheme. Looks very noble.
3902,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Puzzle; Role Playing; Strategy,Daily,I prefer having the oversized power armor if a character is going to have an oversized sword. I also like the more complicated sword design in B.
3903,Male,$0-30k,White,High School,25-34,Strategy; Role Playing; Puzzle; Adventure; Action,Weekly,I chose B since it looks more detailed in a manner of potential higher tiers
3904,Male,$0-30k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Action; Adventure; Role Playing; Simulation; Card,Weekly,"Even though both designs are solid I think Option A's character has more potential in character progression and he seems flawed and conflicted while the other character concept is your typical strong, sturdy, flawless warrior design."
3905,Male,$0-30k,White,High School,25-34,Racing; Arcade; Role Playing; Strategy; Puzzle,Daily,"I like choice A more. I think the design in choice B is a little over the top with the huge armory and sword, so I prefer choice A overall."
3906,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Puzzle; Word; Role Playing,Daily,I chose A because the character looks more realistic to me. His size is more recognizably adult whereas the size of the character in B is absurdly out of proportion. I prefer the more realistic character because it is easier to imagine myself as a character that looks more like I might look.
3907,Male,$61-100k,Black,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Adventure; Action; Role Playing; Strategy; Simulation,Daily,I like option A the best because I like the gold colored clothing and silver armor he is wearing and I like the cross he's wearing.

3910,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Strategy; Role Playing,Weekly,Option B is  a lot better. Looks like a cool character.
3911,Male,$0-30k,Black,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Role Playing; Strategy,Daily,"Option B looks more stronger, intimidating, and powerful than the other design"
3912,Male,$61-100k,White,High School,25-34,Puzzle; Role Playing,Daily,"I guess A is a little more handsome, but B just looks cooler. A looks a lot more sad with puppy dog eyes, which I bet people would love, but B looks tough as nails and like a more interesting character. I also dislike that A seems sort of lost in his armor. B wears his better."
3913,Male,$0-30k,Asian,Associate Degree,25-34,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Role Playing; Simulation,Daily,The character in Option B looks more heroic and powerful. I like design of the sword with the bright accents.
3914,Male,$31-60k,Black,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Puzzle; Strategy; Role Playing; Adventure; Action,Daily,Great armor design and the sword is an fantastic design. I love the size and stature of this character it scream strong and brave.
3915,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,35-44,Trivia; Casino; Card; Racing; Role Playing,Daily,"B has more impressive/bigger armor and a cooler looking sword.  He also has cool facial hair, yeah I'd rather play with B."
3916,Male,$31-60k,Other,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Board; Card; Role Playing; Simulation; Trivia,Daily,I like chunky armor on my warriors so the paladin looking guy in B is my favorite.
3917,Male,$0-30k,White,High School,25-34,Trivia; Sports; Role Playing,Weekly,I prefer A because he is not a hulking behemoth like the character in B. Never liked playing with the huge characters.
3918,Male,$31-60k,White,Graduate Degree,25-34,Simulation; Sports; Strategy; Puzzle; Role Playing,Daily,I feel like option A is more unique looking and more powerful. I think option B is a classic design but one that I have seen in other games .
3919,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Adventure; Card; Role Playing; Strategy; Action,Daily,"B, his armor is awesome, and I like how his sword is yellow, matching his armor. Makes me think he's using some type of special energy for power. Great art on both of them though. A - He looks pretty cool, I like the cross and his sword, but looks kind of wimpy."
3920,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Sports; Action; Adventure; Arcade; Role Playing,Rarely,Looks more distinguished with the distant glance
3921,Male,$0-30k,White,High School,35-44,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Role Playing; Racing,Daily,A looks more like a villain. B gives me the vibe of a proud hero that i want to save the day
3922,Male,$61-100k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Role Playing; Educational; Casino; Adventure; Action,Daily,Option B is alot more bold and looks tougher then the warrior is choice A
3923,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Arcade; Board; Role Playing; Strategy; Adventure,Daily,The proportions and color scheme feel more heroic.
3924,Male,$61-100k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Educational; Sports; Role Playing,Weekly,"I feel choice B has a better color scheme, has more detailed and better design and looks more tough and warrior-like."
3925,Male,$31-60k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Action; Role Playing; Strategy; Puzzle,Monthly,I like B because of the color choices. It makes the character design stand out and makes the character look bad ass.
3926,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Action; Adventure; Educational; Strategy; Role Playing,Daily,This warrior seems more bold and noble.
3927,Male,$31-60k,Asian,Graduate Degree,25-34,Adventure; Music; Role Playing,Daily,I chose option A because I liked the more slender look of the armor being worn by that character. I thought that the armor for the character in option B was less good because of how bulky it looked.
3928,Male,$31-60k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Adventure; Card; Role Playing; Simulation; Strategy,Daily,I chose B because I like the cool look the sword has in B. The weapon in A looks too plain.
3929,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Arcade; Strategy; Trivia; Role Playing; Simulation,Daily,"I like the slimmer profile, in which he looks youthful yet still capable of being a warrior."
3930,Male,$0-30k,Other,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Role Playing; Puzzle,Weekly,A is the better design. Love the colors. B is more standard. Also reminds me of the character Garen from League of Legends.
3931,Male,$0-30k,White,High School,35-44,Board; Adventure; Role Playing; Strategy; Simulation,Monthly,I chose B because I felt the colors were more powerful and the pose much more threatening.
3932,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,35-44,Action; Adventure; Role Playing; Simulation; Strategy,Daily,"Looks more unique, the other looks like every other knight in every other fantasy RPG.  A has personality and looks cool"
3933,Male,$31-60k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Arcade; Role Playing; Sports,Daily,"This character looks a little more interesting to me, they have a bolder, stronger style that makes them look more powerful."
3934,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Role Playing; Simulation; Strategy; Puzzle; Card,Daily,This character looks stronger and in these games I like strong.
3935,Male,$0-30k,White,Less than High School Diploma,35-44,Card; Role Playing; Adventure; Strategy; Arcade,Monthly,"I'm not big on characters with these huge swords that video games have been churning out in the last couple decades, I prefer my weaponry to look more realistic maybe with a touch of flair, but I prefer A out of these two as the look is more realistic and imaginable, I just wish they didn't have huge swords as big as their own body."
3936,Male,$31-60k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Strategy; Action; Adventure; Arcade; Role Playing,Rarely,"The yellow/gold design of this option is classy and striking, and the giant sword is intimidating. Very cool design for sure!"
3937,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Board; Simulation; Strategy; Puzzle; Role Playing,Daily,The character in A looks more unique
3938,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Adventure; Strategy; Role Playing,Daily,"One thing I don't like about either is the giant mega-sized sword.  I don't really like the oversized armor on B either, but I still like him better for his overall look.  His armor is cooler and more impressive."
3939,Male,$0-30k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Role Playing; Strategy,Daily,"Option A looks smaller in stature, more relatable to average person and not setting unrealistic expectations."
3940,Male,$31-60k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Strategy; Role Playing; Simulation,Daily,"I voted for B because the character reminds me of Garen from League of Legends. I would want to get / play this character more because he is bulky and wearing heavy armor, and I prefer tanks and sentinel characters."
3941,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Adventure; Puzzle; Role Playing; Strategy,Daily,I chose option B because I like the over exaggerated features like the large shoulders and large arms.  It makes it look like a fun character to play
3942,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Trivia; Card; Casino; Sports,,i like the action shot of the photo. i think it shows off what they can do
3943,Male,$0-30k,White,High School,25-34,Action; Arcade; Casino; Music; Role Playing,,"Love the larger cannons, they draw the eye better."
3944,Male,$61-100k,Black,Graduate Degree,35-44,Educational; Role Playing; Trivia,,The background and the fierceness of choice A goes along well with the background of the story.
3945,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Adventure; Strategy; Role Playing,,It's a little hard to compare because the image quality is different. The one with the giant rocket (or harpoon?) launcher seems out of theme.  The other two are both good.
3946,Male,$61-100k,Hispanic,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Strategy; Sports; Action; Role Playing; Racing,,I like that she looks some what normal in the face but also is ready to fight based on the weapon that she currently has in her hands.
3947,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Sports,,"Choice A is the design that I like the best because the look she has and the pose she is in just give off the vibe that she is someone that is young, unruly, undisciplined and has a chaotic nature about her to do her young age, upbringing and personality.  I like the way she is posing on the cannon and firing off her gun. I also like the hat and just her chaotic energy. Choice C is second because she looks like someone who has a chaotic vibe to them but more in a serious and punishing way as opposed to the fun chaotic vibe of Choice A. I like her outfit but am not really big on the giant weapon she is holding or the tails that she has. Choice B is last because while the pose is nice I was not really a fan of the top she was wearing. If that was more like the other choices tops the outfit would be great because the rest of it is nice. Also, was not feeling the fish at all."
3948,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Trivia; Puzzle; Educational; Board; Action,,"all of these are good, but they do need color - i like 3 but because its not colored it seems a bit messy. 1 is the simplest, but her legs are way to skinny, they look like she will break them by standing up. i think at age 14 also, the other pirates would have enslaved her, at least this way that she is. she needs to look stronger and more like she can stand up for herself."
3949,Male,$61-100k,Hispanic,Graduate Degree,45-54,Arcade; Sports; Card; Puzzle,,I would rank them in this order.  Choice A does the best job of conveying the character as a young teenage pirate.  You can clearly see that she is a teenager and it best fits the description.
3950,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Action; Arcade; Word,,My first two choices the character seemed like a juvenile but mature enough to make decisions. Last choice the character seemed too wild looking.
3951,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,Strategy; Simulation; Role Playing,,I like the wild look on the face of the character. You never know what she is going to do next. I like how she is sitting on the oversized cannon and shooting off her guns.
3952,Male,$31-60k,White,Graduate Degree,25-34,Simulation; Sports; Strategy; Puzzle; Role Playing,,I think option A looks the most powerful and I like that she seems happy firing her pistol. It really adds to her character
3953,Male,$61-100k,Black,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Adventure; Action; Role Playing; Strategy; Simulation,,I like option C the best because she looks like she comes from a tough background due to her being forced to grow up too early.
3954,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,Action; Arcade; Role Playing; Strategy; Word,,the top rank had some action the last was too busy
3955,Male,$31-60k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Arcade; Role Playing; Sports,,A looks best to me because they have a more fun and exciting energy. This character seems chaotic and energetic which fits the description.
3956,Male,$61-100k,Asian,Graduate Degree,35-44,Casino; Simulation; Adventure; Trivia; Sports,,"Anne looks great here in option C. Love the independent look and that she is wielding a cannon on her shoulder. I think option A is comparable as well. Good, action packed drawing there. Nicely done in each of these drawings. I think option C is easy to see and clear to make out Anne's character from, so I'd go with that as the best choice. But option A is a very nicely done drawing as well."
3957,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Simulation; Puzzle; Adventure,,"B looks a little too old for Anne, even for someone with a rough childhood. A feels she's the right age and comes off a bit unhinged, so very fitting."
3958,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,35-44,Action; Adventure; Role Playing; Simulation; Strategy,,A has personality and charm C looks pretty awesome and really says she is self reliant B is a little plain compared to the rest
3959,Male,$0-30k,Black,High School,25-34,Action; Role Playing; Simulation; Sports; Word,,I like the thrilling design of that one
3960,Male,$0-30k,Other,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Card; Family; Sports; Trivia,,Option B is the best because the image of the female pirate appears to be historically accurate and would make for a great character in a video game or movie.
3961,Male,$31-60k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Action; Arcade; Card; Casino; Educational,,"Between the three different options, I went with option A first as my favorite. I thought that Red-haired Anne had a very crazy look to her in this option and I really loved it. I loved that it would seem to me that people would not want to mess with her as she has no fear when riding a cannon. I loved the details as well. Second, I went with option B as my second choice. I loved how the character, Red-haired Anne, was on the boat as well as all of the fish that surrounded her who looked completely mad and crazy as well. There was also some really great detail in this drawing as well. Finally, option C was my last choice. Red-haired Anne did look good in this photo, but this one just did lack all of the great details that I was able to see in the two previous options. I really had hoped for more action in this photo, but found it to be a little bit dull."
3962,Male,$101k+,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Action; Casino; Role Playing; Sports; Racing,,Like the first two. The last one is just a little to much.  LIttle over done.
3963,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Adventure; Casino; Music; Sports,,Option A is my choice for this role because of her costume and appearance and attitude that really fit with a young pirate.
3964,Male,$0-30k,White,High School,25-34,Sports; Puzzle; Trivia; Word; Card,,"Option A definitely makes her look the most interesting, she is in the middle of action with a smile on her face, and that shows you a lot about her personality. Also the detail on the cannon and the anchor in option A are very appealing. Option B also looks good, and I like how she looks fearless in the midst of danger. I think Option C is a nice drawing, but it doesn't tell me much about the character."
3965,Male,$31-60k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Strategy; Action; Adventure; Arcade; Role Playing,,"I like the weapon in my top choice, which looks a bit like a rocket launcher. Very cool design for sure!"
3966,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Adventure; Arcade; Puzzle; Role Playing; Strategy,,C seems to fit the description best. C and B look like a blonde character to me
3967,Male,$101k+,White,Graduate Degree,25-34,Board; Card; Casino; Sports; Strategy,,It looks more realistic for this situation.  I can picture a young female pirate looking like this.
3968,Male,$61-100k,Asian,Graduate Degree,25-34,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Racing; Sports,,I ranked the designs of the female pirate that I liked the most.  The action image of option A looks the most epic followed by the image of the pirate of option B and then finally option C.
3969,Male,$61-100k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Adventure; Arcade,,C is the best character design for Red-haired Anne as she looks like a badass who has been through a lot. B is good too because it shows Red-haired Anne has command of her ship and is confident. A looks a bit wacky given the facial expression and is not the best choice.
3970,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,35-44,Casino; Adventure; Arcade; Action; Role Playing,,"My top pick looks the most reasonable with that description, she looks fairly normal and not too over the top."
3971,Male,$101k+,Hispanic,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Arcade; Strategy; Music,,I like how fierce she looks which draws me in to the image
3972,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Adventure; Role Playing; Strategy,,I think b captures the youthfulness and ready to fight the best.
3973,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Strategy; Word,,"I don't like how option b has her legs spread so much, but I do like the lady with the huge cannon"
3974,Male,$0-30k,White,High School,25-34,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Music; Puzzle,,I picked A and B as my top choices as I love the designs of the women.
3975,Male,$31-60k,White,Graduate Degree,45-54,Puzzle; Role Playing; Strategy; Word,,"These are all great sketches. C is the least interesting just because it is more of a pose than an action sense. Between A and B, I slightly prefer A just because it looks a little more crazed."
3976,Male,$61-100k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Strategy; Role Playing,,I liked choice A since the character is sitting on a canon which makes them look very confident and strong since there is a lot going on behind them. Choice C looks too plain and the stance they are in isn't eye catching or appealing.
3977,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Casino; Puzzle; Trivia,,I don__ like her hair in C and I like the pose and look of her in A the best on the cannon. I think the weapons look too large in C as well. I don__ care for the fish in B but like the gun she has there. A overall has the best look however.
3978,Male,$31-60k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Strategy; Trivia; Simulation; Casino; Puzzle,,I chose pirates that seemed both exciting and fun
3979,Male,$0-30k,Black,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Casino; Racing,,I picked B and C as the two that I like becuase she looks more composed in those.
3980,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Word,,"The action shows are cool and fit well, but I prefer the simple picture that just shows the character off well."
3981,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Casino; Adventure; Strategy,,The all action shot is perfect for this female character based on her tough conditions growing up
3982,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,45-54,Role Playing; Arcade; Card; Puzzle; Trivia,,"I'm assuming this is for a phone game?  keep in mind the phone screen is small, and a lot of the smaller details are lost in it.  so less background ""noise"" so the character doesn't get lost on the screen the better."
3983,Male,$61-100k,Hispanic,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Adventure; Puzzle; Action; Strategy; Arcade,,B fits the pirate theme the best
3984,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Arcade; Action; Adventure,,"Option A is the one I prefer by far due to the character appearing to be upbeat.  They relish their rebelliousness and attitude.  I like that.  It makes me want to side with them.  Option B is my least favorite.  The character seems too sickly or something, making her unlikable.  She's too dark.  She's too brooding.  I far prefer the devil-may-care attitude of Option A.  Option C is sort of in the middle.  She seems mischievous more than rebellious or insidious.  That makes her somewhat likable but not entirely so."
3985,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Strategy; Sports; Action; Adventure; Educational,,"Option C is the best for me mainly because it's the least cartoon like and there is a wider variety of dark and light shading, while the others lack similar shading details."
3986,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Arcade; Casino; Puzzle; Sports; Word,,"C IS ATTRACTIVE, SIMPLE AND SEXY.  SHE LOOKS HOT AND DEADLY"
3987,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Role Playing; Simulation; Strategy; Puzzle; Card,,The first one on the ship with zombie pihrana is neat and I think something I haven't seen before. The second one seems familiar but I think is unique enough that it's fun. The last one is just a pirate version of Jynx from League of Legends.
3988,Male,$31-60k,Hispanic,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Casino; Adventure; Music,,i like this order the best. the first two are my favorite and it was a toss up between the two. they look the most cool and fun. the last is good but looks more like a dream than an action setting
3989,Male,$101k+,Hispanic,Graduate Degree,45-54,Board; Casino; Role Playing; Sports; Trivia,,Ranked them based on which one made her look more like a pirate.  My first choice is an obvious one as I she appears more natural.  Second choice is a bit extreme but better than the third which appears to be more sexual in nature.  I doubt pirate women dressed that provocatively.
3990,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Racing; Trivia,,"I would pick C first, i think she looks like more of the rebel. The cannon over the shoulder, the look. I would pick this one first."
3991,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Casino; Puzzle; Strategy; Word,,"Option B fits most with the description of the character.  It shows her as a pirate on a ship.  Option A is second because the way the drawing is makes it hard to see the character, she blends in.  Option C is a good drawing but it does not fit the description as well."
3992,Male,$61-100k,Hispanic,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Strategy; Sports; Action; Role Playing; Racing,,I like the details that you can both see on her face and her hands. It looks like she has some kind of ball in one of her hands. Meaning she is ready for battle.
3993,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Adventure; Casino; Music; Sports,,Option C is my choice for this character because she looks much more like someone who is determined to take revenge.
3994,Male,$61-100k,Black,Graduate Degree,35-44,Educational; Role Playing; Trivia,,I believe choice B has a sense of beauty and revenge as compared to the other 2 choices.
3995,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Arcade; Card; Educational; Puzzle; Music,,I like the more evil approaches to the sea creatures. Choice A is very passive and in the background not foreground
3996,Male,$0-30k,White,High School,45-54,Role Playing; Adventure; Action,,I like the facial features and hair on the first choice I made but I like the girl holding the skull particularly because of the skull on my second choice
3997,Male,$61-100k,Hispanic,Graduate Degree,45-54,Arcade; Sports; Card; Puzzle,,I would rank them in this order with choice B as my 1st choice.  Choice B definitely gets across anger directed at humans by showing her holding a human skull.  You can take that to mean that she probably killed that human and that she is getting her revenge against humans.
3998,Male,$0-30k,White,High School,25-34,Action; Arcade; Casino; Music; Role Playing,,The larger bodys make her stand  so I like those better.
3999,Male,$31-60k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Arcade; Role Playing; Sports,,"C looks best to me because they have a somewhat pleasant look, but also have a sinister style which fits the description well."
4000,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Arcade; Casino; Puzzle; Sports; Word,,C IS A LITTLE MORE ATTRACTIVE.  THE ANGLE IT SHOWS HER OFF IS THE BEST AND YOU CAN SEE THE MOST DETAIL
4001,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Trivia; Card; Casino; Sports,,my 1st choice looks like she is the best looking pic. she stands out and looks cool
4002,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Trivia; Puzzle; Educational; Board; Action,,"1 has cold, empty, evil eyes that work well with the story. 2 is nice and very sharp looking - as in knife sharp edges, waist and tail and appears to have horns used for attack. 3 is well done too though, 3 looks a bit evil, but more because of the long finger tips rather than the face."
4003,Male,$31-60k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Action; Arcade; Card; Casino; Educational,,"Between the three different options, my favorite was option B. I thought that Medea looked extremely fierce in this depiction and that she was absolutely not a being that a person or otherwise would really want to encounter. I really enjoyed the detail in the drawing and I thought it was great to have her holding skulls as well. Second, I went with option C as my second choice. This character also had a very dangerous look and I especially liked that she was holding what looked like weapons as well. This was a great detail and I liked their shading. Finally, option A was my final and least favorite choice. I enjoyed the detail, but felt that the character looked much more like a monster that was forming into something else, which I had seen done many times before and it was far too familiar."
4004,Male,$61-100k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Action; Arcade; Word,,My first two options show off the character as someone who used to a normal timid character but had to turn stronger and daring to fight the humans.
4005,Male,$61-100k,Black,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Adventure; Action; Role Playing; Strategy; Simulation,,I like option C the best because she looks like she is hell bent on getting revenge on the humans.
4006,Male,$31-60k,White,Graduate Degree,25-34,Simulation; Sports; Strategy; Puzzle; Role Playing,,I like option C because I think she looks the most powerful and like she wants revenge
4007,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,Strategy; Simulation; Role Playing,,This is a character who is sick and tired of the humans who are encroaching on her territory. She wants to take matters into her own hands which is why the daggers fit so well with her character.
4008,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Strategy; Casino; Arcade,,A has an aura of power about it - very strong. C seems like a powerful image and very strong. B - Not a big fan it seems very bland
4009,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,Action; Arcade; Role Playing; Strategy; Word,,the front views are better.  The top pick has more action
4010,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Simulation; Puzzle; Adventure,,C is threating and yet still has some beauty to her design. A is similar but gives off more of an apathetic tone to it. B is just okay the whole holding a skull thing is way overdone already.
4011,Male,$61-100k,Asian,Graduate Degree,35-44,Casino; Simulation; Adventure; Trivia; Sports,,"Medea looks best from the angle in option C. This is great here and gives her a lot of character with a menacing, threatening look. Lovely design here and she looks the best in this option. Option A and B are not as fierce and fiery. I'd go with option C with the daggers in hand here."
4012,Male,$0-30k,Other,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Card; Family; Sports; Trivia,,Option B is the best because the image of the hybrid serpentine female appears to be inspired by greek and eastern mythology.
4013,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,35-44,Action; Adventure; Role Playing; Simulation; Strategy,,A feels perfect she seems like someone who was once pure and good who became twisted and cruel. C  and B are both okay but just feel like they lack the presence of option A
4014,Male,$0-30k,Black,High School,25-34,Action; Role Playing; Simulation; Sports; Word,,These these designs almost look the same
4015,Male,$101k+,White,High School,35-44,Casino; Strategy; Simulation; Sports; Role Playing,,I think the dark hair works best on an underwater sea creature.  C looks like she would be the fiercest of them all.
4016,Male,$101k+,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Action; Casino; Role Playing; Sports; Racing,,They all are very good.  Very good beaty on each but does not lose the intimdation factor.  That is good combo for this person.
4017,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,45-54,Family; Puzzle; Action; Role Playing; Strategy,,"Option C looks most like a character who is ready for battle. Option A at least looks a little ticked off and ready for revenge. Option B just looks like a witch who is having a good time, she does not look angry or vengeful."
4018,Male,$0-30k,White,High School,25-34,Sports; Puzzle; Trivia; Word; Card,,"I like the dagger she is wielding in option C. That combined with her stance makes her look  the most menacing and dangerous of them all. Option B also looks a little menacing due to the skull she is holding. I don't much care for the pose in Option A, it does not seem to convey the right message."
4019,Male,$101k+,White,Graduate Degree,25-34,Board; Card; Casino; Sports; Strategy,,She looks like she's pissed off and ready to take revenge.  She looks more aggressive.
4020,Male,$31-60k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Strategy; Action; Adventure; Arcade; Role Playing,,"The face of my top choice looks striking and intimidating, which is appealing. Very cool design for sure!"
4021,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Adventure; Arcade; Puzzle; Role Playing; Strategy,,I think B looks like someon that would normally be nice and mild until pushed too far
4022,Male,$61-100k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Adventure; Arcade,,"I think C and A are the best character designs for Medea. I picture someone who is vengeful and angry, and these two designs exemplify that. I think B would look better if the hair was made darker, as that would seem more menacing."
4023,Male,$61-100k,Asian,Graduate Degree,25-34,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Racing; Sports,,I prefer the design of the mermaid creature of option C the most followed by the design of option B and then finally option A.
4024,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,35-44,Casino; Adventure; Arcade; Action; Role Playing,,"In my top pick she looks like she came from a tranquil life, but still has that edge that she can be nasty if needed."
4025,Male,$101k+,Hispanic,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Arcade; Strategy; Music,,I like how fierce she looks which draws me in to the image
4026,Male,$101k+,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Adventure; Role Playing; Strategy,,I think c shows the ready to fight warrior the best.
4027,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Strategy; Word,,"Option a makes you look very weak, but I think that option c is very strong and intimidating"
4028,Male,$31-60k,White,Graduate Degree,45-54,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Trivia; Educational,,Medea looks scariest in Option C and I'm guessing you're going for scary and somewhat sexy here.
4029,Male,$0-30k,White,High School,25-34,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Music; Puzzle,,I picked A and B as my top choices as the designs tell me that the women are very powerful.
4030,Male,$31-60k,White,Graduate Degree,45-54,Puzzle; Role Playing; Strategy; Word,,"C looks the most menacing, A has too much of a pin-up look for me. B is in between."
4031,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Strategy; Role Playing; Simulation; Action; Adventure,,It's the tail.  It's super spikey.  That makes her look intimidating and therefore fitting the profile best
4032,Male,$31-60k,White,Graduate Degree,35-44,Strategy; Trivia; Simulation; Casino; Puzzle,,I picked based on who I thought looked like they area about to seek vengeance.
4033,Male,$61-100k,Asian,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Strategy; Role Playing,,I liked choice C and how the character looks strong and scary since they are in an attack stance. Choice C looks plan and not scary or intimidating sine they are in a pose which makes them looking behind.
4034,Male,$0-30k,Black,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Adventure; Arcade; Casino; Racing,,I picked A and C because she looks the meanest in those.
4035,Male,$61-100k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Action; Word,,I feel like the darker hair better fits the character.  My last 2 choices best reflect that in my opinion.
4036,Male,$31-60k,White,Bachelor's Degree,25-34,Casino; Adventure; Strategy,,I prioritized based on most feared looking face as this is a woman seeking revenge
4037,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Strategy; Sports; Action; Adventure; Educational,,"Option B is my choice for this type of character because the level of detail with the lighter shading and the lighter hair is easier to see than the darker shades of the other choices, so for me it would look better blended into a water themed background."
4038,Male,$61-100k,Hispanic,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Adventure; Puzzle; Action; Strategy; Arcade,,C looks the best fleshed out drawing
4039,Male,$31-60k,White,High School,45-54,Role Playing; Arcade; Card; Puzzle; Trivia,,"my top choice looks more like she is about to take action against something.  I don't know why, I just like the facial expression better."
4040,Male,$101k+,Asian,Graduate Degree,35-44,Adventure; Strategy,,I really love option C because she appears like she wants revenge and also has some sick looking daggers. Choice A looks fierce but also slightly inviting due to the way she is beckoning you on. Choice B is interesting but I'm not sure if the pearl she holds is a weapon and not certain about the purpose of the skull.
4041,Male,$0-30k,White,Bachelor's Degree,35-44,Arcade; Action; Adventure,,"I think all of them look really good.  They're imposing but attractive, and give a sense of menace and anger.  I like Option C the best, though.  I think she looks the coolest wielding the knives, and also has cool details around her pelvis and breasts.  She's also the most attractive, I think.  Option B is also cool holding the skull.  Option A is cool, too, but is just slightly less interesting, without any cool accessories.  She also seems the least attractive."
